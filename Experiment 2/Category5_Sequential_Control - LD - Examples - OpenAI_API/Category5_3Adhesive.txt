Given the task of implementing a specific process step from an ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production in a 61131-3 Ladder Diagram (LD) program, we will focus on a key phase of the process - the reaction step (B.2). This is a critical stage where various ingredients are mixed and reacted under controlled conditions to produce the adhesive.

For this example, let's assume the reaction step requires:
- Pre-heating the reactor to a specified temperature.
- Adding the main ingredient once the temperature is reached.
- Maintaining the reaction for a set duration.
- Cooling down the reactor after the reaction is complete.

### LD Program for the Reaction Step (B.2)

Here's how the program might be represented in ASCII-art style LD:

```

|                                               |
|  [Start_Step]         +---+    [Heater_ON]    |
+-----( )---------------| TON |--------( )------+
|                    PreHeatTime                |
|                                               |
|  -------------------------                     |
|  | Temp >= ReactTemp  |   +---+   [Add_Material] |
+-----( )---------------| TON |--------- ( )-------+
|                    ReactionTime                |
|                                               |
|  -------------------------                     |
|  | Timer Done       | +---+  [Heater_OFF]    |
+-----( )-------------| TON |------( )---------+
|                  CoolDownTime                |
|                                               |
|  -------------------------                     |
|  | Temp < SafeTemp  |                         |
+-----( )---------------------------------------+
|                                               |
|                [End_Step]                     |
+-----------------------------------------------+
```

### Explanation:
- `[Start_Step]`: This input is activated to begin the reaction step.
- `PreHeatTime`: A timer `TON` that controls the duration for pre-heating the reactor. The input condition for this timer is the start of the step, and its output `[Heater_ON]` activates the heater.
- `Temp >= ReactTemp`: A condition checking if the temperature meets or exceeds the reaction temperature. Once true, it triggers the next timer for material addition.
- `[Add_Material]`: The output to dispense the main ingredient into the reactor.
- `ReactionTime`: A timer `TON` measuring the duration of the reaction. On completion, it initiates the cooling phase by turning off the heater `[Heater_OFF]`.
- `CoolDownTime`: This timer `TON` ensures the reactor cools to a safe temperature.
- `Temp < SafeTemp`: Checks if the temperature is below a safe level.
- `[End_Step]`: The output signal indicating the completion of the reaction phase, allowing the process to transition to the next step.

### Process Parameters:
- `PreHeatTime`, `ReactionTime`, and `CoolDownTime` would be set according to the chemical properties of the materials used and safety considerations.
- `ReactTemp` and `SafeTemp` are predefined constants that represent the required temperatures for the reaction and safe handling, respectively.

### Control Logic for Method Calls:
This simplified outline would be expanded in a real-world scenario to include checks for failures, abnormal conditions, and integration with supervisory control systems. In practical applications, these process steps and transitions are often controlled by software that supports the ISA-88 standard, providing a structured approach to batch control. This ASCII-art LD diagram serves as a conceptual representation, illustrating the fundamental logic behind managing a reaction step in adhesive production.
