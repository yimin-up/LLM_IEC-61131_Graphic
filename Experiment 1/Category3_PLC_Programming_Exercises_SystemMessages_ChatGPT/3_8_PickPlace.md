You are an AI expert in PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming. You are familiar with the international standard IEC 61131 for PLCs.
Your task is to write IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programs according to the requirements delimited by triple quotes.
'''
Write a PLC program in ST according to IEC 61131-3, for a pick-and-place application for a robot with two conveyors. Here is the description of the process:

Whole machine has two modes: auto and manual
Manual Mode: When the button Manual is pressed, the robotic arm will begin to execute the manual control process: pressing Clip to clip the product from conveyor A, pressing Transfer to move the product to conveyor B, and pressing Release to release the product and send it away by conveyor B.
Auto Mode: When the button Auto is pressed, the robotic arm will begin to execute the auto control process once: clip the product (keep holding this product before releasing it), then transfer the product (the action takes 2 seconds), and then lastly release the product. The auto control process can be performed one more time if the button Auto is pressed again.
Manual control process and auto control process are interlocked.

To write a PLC program for a pick-and-place application using Structured Text (ST) in accordance with IEC 61131-3, the program must manage the control logic for both manual and automatic modes of a robotic arm operating with two conveyors. Here's an example of how such a program might be structured:

```iec
PROGRAM PickAndPlace
    VAR
        AutoMode, ManualMode: BOOL; // Mode selectors
        Clip, Transfer, Release: BOOL; // Manual control inputs
        AutoBtnPressed, AutoProcessRunning: BOOL; // Auto mode control
        AutoTimer: TON; // Timer for auto mode
    END_VAR

    // Initialization
    AutoTimer(IN:=FALSE, PT:=T#2s);

    // Check for mode selection
    IF AutoBtnPressed AND NOT AutoProcessRunning THEN
        AutoMode := TRUE;
        ManualMode := FALSE;
        AutoProcessRunning := TRUE;
        AutoTimer(IN:=TRUE);
    ELSIF ManualMode THEN
        AutoMode := FALSE;
        AutoProcessRunning := FALSE;
    END_IF

    // Manual mode operations
    IF ManualMode THEN
        IF Clip THEN
            // Code to clip the product from conveyor A
        END_IF
        IF Transfer THEN
            // Code to move the product to conveyor B
        END_IF
        IF Release THEN
            // Code to release the product on conveyor B
        END_IF
    END_IF

    // Auto mode operations
    IF AutoMode THEN
        // Code to clip the product from conveyor A
        IF AutoTimer.Q THEN
            // Code to move and release the product on conveyor B
            AutoMode := FALSE;
            AutoProcessRunning := FALSE;
            AutoTimer(IN:=FALSE);
        END_IF
    END_IF

    // Reset AutoMode if button is released
    IF NOT AutoBtnPressed AND AutoProcessRunning THEN
        AutoMode := FALSE;
        AutoProcessRunning := FALSE;
    END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```

This program outlines the basic logic for a pick-and-place robot with two operational modes: manual and automatic.

In Manual Mode, the robot responds to individual inputs for clipping, transferring, and releasing products.
In Auto Mode, the robot performs a sequence of actions (clip, transfer, and release) automatically, with a 2-second delay for the transfer action.
Interlocking between modes is achieved by toggling the AutoMode and ManualMode variables. The AutoTimer is used to manage the delay in Auto Mode. The program is structured to handle mode transitions and ensure that manual and automatic processes do not overlap.

This is a simplified example and assumes that additional implementation details (such as the specific actions to clip, transfer, and release products) are integrated as per the hardware and control requirements of the specific robot and conveyors in use.
