## Elevator Control with SFC in IEC 61131-3

Due to the complexity of the elevator system, the complete SFC program would be quite extensive. However, I can provide you with a structural outline and key elements to guide your development:

**Variables:**

*   **CurrentFloor**: INT (1-5) - Stores the current floor of the elevator.
*   **TargetFloor**: INT (1-5) - Stores the target floor based on button presses.
*   **Direction**: BOOL - TRUE for Up, FALSE for Down.
*   **DoorTimer**: TIMER - 7-second timer for door opening.
*   **IdleTimer**: TIMER - 10-second timer for inactivity.
*   **FloorButtons**: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL - Stores the state of up/down buttons on each floor.
*   **CabinButtons**: ARRAY[1..5] OF BOOL - Stores the state of buttons inside the cabin.
*   **LimitSwitches**: ARRAY[1..5] OF STRUCT - Each element has two BOOLs: Top and Bottom.

**Steps:**

1.  **Initial Step**:
    *   Check if any cabin or floor buttons are pressed.
    *   If yes, determine the target floor and direction based on the pressed buttons and current floor.
    *   Start moving the elevator in the determined direction.
2.  **Moving Steps**:
    *   Have separate steps for moving up and down.
    *   In each step, monitor the limit switches of the current floor.
    *   If the appropriate limit switch is activated, stop the motor and proceed to the next step.
3.  **Door Opening Step**:
    *   Start the DoorTimer.
    *   Open the elevator doors.
    *   Reset the IdleTimer.
4.  **Door Closing Step**:
    *   Check if the DoorTimer has elapsed or any cabin/floor button is pressed on the current floor.
    *   If yes, close the doors and proceed to the next step.
5.  **Idle Step**:
    *   Check if the IdleTimer has elapsed and no buttons are pressed.
    *   If yes, remain in the idle state.
    *   If any button is pressed, determine the target floor and direction, then go to the appropriate moving step.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   You may need additional steps for error handling and emergency situations.
*   Ensure proper safety interlocks are implemented to prevent unsafe operation.
*   The SFC program can be further modularized by creating separate charts for specific functions like door control or button handling.

**Remember:** This is just a basic framework. You will need to expand upon it and incorporate specific details based on your exact requirements and the capabilities of your PLC system. Make sure to consult the IEC 61131-3 standard for proper syntax and usage of SFC elements.
