> Write a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program, not a function block, to control the temperature of a heating system. The system should automatically turn on and off based on three temperature sensors and maintain a constant temperature range between 20 and 22 degree celsius.

# GPT4
To control a heating system with the objective of maintaining a temperature range between 20 and 22 degrees Celsius using three temperature sensors in a PLC program, we'll use a majority voting logic on the sensors to increase system reliability. If at least two out of the three sensors indicate that the temperature is below 20°C, the heater will turn on. Conversely, if at least two sensors indicate the temperature is 22°C or above, the heater will turn off. This will be illustrated in Ladder Diagram (LD) form below.

Please note, ASCII art representation has its limitations and might not capture all the nuances of a graphical ladder logic program. In practice, this would be created using the editor provided by PLC programming software (e.g., TIA Portal for Siemens PLCs, RSLogix for Allen Bradley PLCs, etc.).

- **Description of Operation:**
   1. **Heater ON Logic:** The heater is turned on (`Heater ON` coil) if at least two of the three temperature sensors (T1, T2, T3) read below 20°C, indicating the temperature is too low and needs to be increased. This is implemented through a set of parallel paths where any two sensors below 20°C will complete the circuit.
   2. **Heater OFF Logic:** The heater is switched off (`Heater OFF` coil) once the temperature reaches 22°C or above as detected by at least two out of three temperature sensors. Similar to the `Heater ON` logic, these are again arranged in a majority voting configuration to ensure reliability. The `NOT Heater` logic ensures there's a condition check to prevent contradictory actions (i.e., both turning the heater on and off at the same time if there was an error in sensor readings).

Note: This logic can be further refined by adding interlocks, manual override capabilities, or handling sensor fault conditions, depending on the specific requirements and safety considerations of your system.
