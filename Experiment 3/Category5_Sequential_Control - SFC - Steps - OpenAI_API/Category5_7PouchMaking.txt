Step 1:####
Inputs:
- Start button: Initiates the start-up sequence.
- Stop button: Initiates the shutdown sequence.
- Raw material tension sensor: Provides feedback on the tension of the raw material.

Outputs:
- Heating stations: Controls the 8 heating stations.
- Cooling stations: Controls the 8 cooling stations.
- Horizontal cutter: Controls the operation of the horizontal cutter.
- Vertical cutter: Controls the operation of the vertical cutter.
- Feeder units: Controls the operation of the two feeder units to maintain proper tension.

Step 2:####
State Machine Description:
1. **Initialization**: Ensure the system is ready for start-up, checking safety protocols.
2. **Start-Up Sequence**:
   - **Heating Start**: Activate heating stations progressively.
   - **Stabilize Tension**: Start feeder units to stabilize raw material tension before full operation.
   - **Cooling Start**: Activate cooling stations once the heating phase is stable.
   - **Cutting System Activation**: Bring the horizontal and vertical cutters online after the cooling stations stabilize.
3. **Operational**: The system runs with all components functioning.
4. **Shutdown Sequence**:
   - **Cutting System Shutdown**: Deactivate cutters first to prevent any additional material processing.
   - **Cooling Stop**: Deactivate cooling stations.
   - **Heating Stop**: Deactivate heating stations last to prevent damage to partially treated materials.
   - **Tension Release**: Gradually release tension in the feeder units.
5. **System Ready**: The system is shut down and ready to be started again.

Step 4:####
1. **Initialization**: Prepares the machine for start-up, checking all necessary systems and safety features.
2. **Heating Start**: Gradually brings the heating stations to operational levels to treat material properly.
3. **Stabilize Tension**: Engages feeder units to control the tension of the raw material, ensuring smooth flow.
4. **Cooling Start**: Initiates the cooling process to solidify and stabilize the product after heating.
5. **Cutting Systems Activation**: Engages both cutters for shaping the final product.
6. **Operational**: The machine operates under normal conditions with all processes functioning together.
7. **Shutdown Sequence**:
   - **7.1 Cutting System Shutdown**: Turns off cutters to stop processing the material.
   - **7.2 Cooling Stop**: Gradually powers down the cooling stations.
   - **7.3 Heating Stop**: Safely turns off heating stations to avoid damaging any remaining materials in the process area.
   - **7.4 Tension Release**: Feeder units slow down and stop, releasing any tension in the system to prevent damage.
8. **System Ready**: The machine is fully shut down and is in a safe state for the next start-up.

Step 5:####
The above SFC is checked according to the IEC 61131 standard by ensuring:
- Clear separation of states for startup and shutdown sequences.
- Sequential transitions that ensure the proper order of operations and machine safety.
- Properly defined inputs and outputs relevant to each step's functionality.
- The inclusion of initial and final states to denote the start and end of the machine's operation cycle.
- This ensures the SFC is structured, systematic, and adheres to the safety and operational standards recommended for industrial control systems.
