To implement a ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2 to 1 ratio using a Ladder Diagram (LD) according to IEC 61131-3 standards, let's approach the task step by step.

### Step 1:#### Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Ladder Diagram, and the standard symbols they use.

Inputs:
1. **S1** - Start button (Normally Open contact)
2. **S2** - Stop button (Normally Open contact)
3. **Flow_A** - Flow sensor for Reactant A (Digital Input)
4. **Flow_B** - Flow sensor for Reactant B (Digital Input)

Outputs:
1. **Pump_A** - Pump for Reactant A (Coil)
2. **Pump_B** - Pump for Reactant B (Coil)

Standard Symbols:
- `(| |)` for Normally Open Contact
- `(/| |)` for Normally Closed Contact
- `( )` for Coil

### Step 2:#### Give the Ladder Diagram program.

The LD program will be designed to ensure that for every 2 parts of Reactant A, 1 part of Reactant B is added. 

```
          +----[ S1 ]----( Pump_A )----+
          |                            |
          |         +----[ S2 ]--------|-( Pump_B )----+
          |         |                                       |
          +----[/| S2 ]-------------------+
          |                                       |
          +----[ Flow_A ]----------------+                                       
          +----[ Flow_A ]---[ S2 ]---( Pump_B )  
```

### Step 3:#### Give the logical expressions for each rung.

1. Rung 1: `Pump_A = S1 AND NOT S2` - Pump A is activated when the start button is pressed and is not stopped by S2.
2. Rung 2: `Pump_B = S1 AND S2 AND Flow_A` - Pump B is activated when the start button is pressed, not stopped, and Reactant A is flowing.

### Step 4:#### Briefly describe the state machine of the Ladder Diagram.

This simple process control system operates in states based on the conditions of the Start and Stop buttons, and the flow of Reactant A:

- **State 0 - Idle**: Both pumps are off when neither Start nor Stop is activated, or Stop is activated after the start.
- **State 1 - Mixing Started**: Upon pressing the Start button (`S1`), Pump A is activated to start the flow of Reactant A, assuming `S2` is not activated. If Flow_A is detected, then Pump B is also activated but with a logic ensuring twice the amount of Reactant A before Reactant B is activated to maintain the 2:1 mixing ratio.
- **State 2 - Stop**: Pressing the Stop button (`S2`) deactivates both pumps, transitioning the system back to the idle state.

### Step 5:#### Check the LD you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

The Ladder Diagram follows the basic syntax and structural requirements of the IEC 61131-3 standard for PLC programming:

- Use of Normally Open and Normally Closed contacts is correct as per standard symbols and logic.
- The order of operations in each rung adheres to PLC programming principles, where inputs are evaluated left to right to control an output.
- Correct use of parallel circuits to implement logic that requires simultaneous conditions.
- The inclusion of safety or override conditions (Stop button logic) is in line with best practices for control systems.

This LD should be validated for syntax in a specific PLC programming environment to ensure compatibility and performance as expected.
