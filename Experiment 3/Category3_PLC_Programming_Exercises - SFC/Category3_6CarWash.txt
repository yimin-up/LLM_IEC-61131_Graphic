To design a PLC program using Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for an automatic car wash station according to your requirements, we'll outline the process in steps as per IEC 61131-3 standards. Since the actual SFC graphical language cannot be represented exactly in ASCII art, the following textual description aims to outline the structure and logic of the program.

### Description of Elements in SFC for an Automatic Car Wash:

1. **Initial Step (Power On)**: The starting point of the car wash system.
2. **Step 1 (Car Detection)**: The system checks for the presence of a car using a sensor.
3. **Transition 1**: Checking that a car is detected and no human is present.
4. **Step 2 (Car Wash)**: The car wash process is initiated.
5. **Transition 2**: Monitoring if a human enters the car wash area during the process.
6. **Step 3 (Alarm)**: If a human is detected, the system stops washing and triggers an alarm.
7. **Step 4 (End Process)**: Process ends, waiting for a reset or another car.

                                        End Process    Send Alarm & Wait for Reset
```

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Power On**: The system initializes, getting ready to detect a car.
2. **Step 1 - Car Detection**: Here, the system is waiting to detect a car via the sensor. If no car is present, it remains in this step.
3. **Transition 1**: Moves to the next step if and only if a car is detected AND no human presence is detected in the area.
4. **Step 2 - Car Wash**: Starts the washing sequence with various stages (e.g., water, soap, rinse, dry). Any human detection during this process might be unsafe, leading to the next transition check.
5. **Transition 2**: If a human enters the car wash area during the wash process, the transition to the alarm step is triggered.
6. **Step 3 - Alarm**: The car wash stops immediately, and an alarm is triggered to indicate human presence. This step handles emergency stopping and notifies the operator or the safety systems.
7. **Step 4 - End Process**: After the car wash completes or an alarm is triggered and reset, the system transitions to this step to signify the end of the process. It can then reset to wait for another car or if the manual reset is triggered after handling the alarm situation.

Please note, in a real PLC environment, each of these steps and transitions would be associated with specific inputs (e.g., sensors for car and human detection), outputs (e.g., actuators for wash mechanisms, alarms), and potentially intermediate condition checks for safety and operational status. Implementing this SFC design would require detailed programming in a development environment that supports IEC 61131-3, using function blocks, ladder logic, or structured text for the actual actions within each step and transition depending on the PLC's programming language capabilities.
