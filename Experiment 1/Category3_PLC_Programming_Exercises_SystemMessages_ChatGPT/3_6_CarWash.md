You are an AI expert in PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming. You are familiar with the international standard IEC 61131 for PLCs.
Your task is to write IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programs according to the requirements delimited by triple quotes.
'''
Write a PLC program in ST according to IEC 61131-3 to create an automatic car wash station with only one station. Station detects if a car is there by a sensor and if no human is present (In the car wash area) then it start to wash to car. If there is any human detected in the car wash area then the car wash station should stop and send an alarm.

To address your request, we'll design a simplified PLC program for an automatic car wash station using Structured Text (ST), according to IEC 61131-3 standards. This example assumes we have a sensor to detect the car's presence (`CarPresentSensor`) and a sensor to detect human presence in the car wash area (`HumanPresentSensor`). Also included are the controls for starting and stopping the car wash (`StartWash` and `StopWash`) and an alarm signal (`AlarmSignal`).

```pascal
PROGRAM CarWashStation
VAR
    CarPresentSensor : BOOL; // TRUE if car is detected, FALSE otherwise
    HumanPresentSensor : BOOL; // TRUE if human is detected, FALSE otherwise
    StartWash : BOOL; // Control to start the car wash
    StopWash : BOOL; // Control to stop the car wash immediately
    AlarmSignal : BOOL; // Activated if human presence detected during operation
END_VAR

// Car wash process control logic
IF CarPresentSensor THEN
    IF HumanPresentSensor THEN
        StopWash := TRUE; // Stop the car wash if a human is detected
        AlarmSignal := TRUE; // Activate alarm
        StartWash := FALSE; // Ensure car wash does not start
    ELSE
        AlarmSignal := FALSE; // Deactivate alarm if no human detected
        StopWash := FALSE; // Make sure the stop command is reset
        StartWash := TRUE; // Start car wash if only the car is detected
    END_IF;
ELSE
    StartWash := FALSE; // Don't start washing if no car is present
    StopWash := FALSE; // Ensure car wash is not stopped unnecessarily
    AlarmSignal := FALSE; // Reset alarm signal if conditions are clear
END_IF;

// Additional logic can be added here for handling the operations of the car wash,
// such as water spray, soap application, brushes, drying, etc.,
// controlled by `StartWash` and `StopWash`.
```

Note that `StartWash` and `StopWash` can be used as conditions to control the respective actuators and devices in the car wash process, like water pumps, soap dispensers, brushes, and air blowers. The `AlarmSignal` can be linked to an audible or visual alarm to alert personnel to the unsafe condition.
