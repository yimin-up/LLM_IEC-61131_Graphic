Designing a PLC program for a pick-and-place application using Sequential Function Chart (SFC) involves creating a structure that can switch between Auto and Manual modes, and control the actions (Clip, Transfer, Release) in each mode. The process follows IEC 61131-3 standards. Let's define the SFC steps and transitions based on the provided process description. 

Please note, the actual implementation and integration into a PLC programming environment would require translating this ASCII representation into the specific software's format and possibly adding more details to the action blocks (like timers, sensors check, etc.).

+-------------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **Start**: Initial step where the system starts.
- **Mode Selection**: The system waits for the user to select either Auto or Manual mode.
- **Mode: Manual**: In this mode, the process waits for the operator to press the "Clip", "Transfer", and "Release" buttons to perform each action manually.
- **Mode: Auto**: In this mode, the process automatically performs clip, wait (simulation of 2-second transfer action), and release of the item in a sequence. If the "Auto" button is pressed again during or after completion, the sequence is repeated.
- **Clip Item**: Action state where the robotic arm clips the item from Conveyor A.
- **Transfer Item**: Action state where the robotic arm moves the item from Conveyor A to Conveyor B. In Auto mode, a 2-second wait mimics this action.
- **Release Item**: Action state where the robotic arm releases the item onto Conveyor B.

Note: The implementation of transitions like pressing buttons needs to be handled by the PLC's input signals. The waiting in Auto mode (for example, to simulate the 2-second transfer time) could be implemented using timers.

This SFC is a high-level representation to guide the programming process. The actual implementation would need to define conditions for transitions (such as inputs from sensors or buttons) and actions (to activate/deactivate motors or solenoids) more precisely in the PLC software following the IEC 61131-3 standard.
