To design an Entry/Exit Control program for an Underground Car Park according to IEC 61131-3 in Structured Text (ST), we first define the logic that controls the Red and Green lights based on the input from the photoelectric switches and intermediate variables. The program should ensure safety and efficiency in vehicle movement through the entry/exit passage with the conditions provided. 

Here's how the program could be structured:

```pascal
PROGRAM UndergroundCarParkControl
VAR
    X1, X2: BOOL; // Photoelectric switches
    M1, M2, M3, M4: BOOL; // Intermediate signals
    M20, M30: BOOL; // Control signals for passage engagement
    Y1, Y2: BOOL; // Outputs for Red and Green lights
END_VAR

// Initial settings for Green lights ON and Red lights OFF
Y1 := FALSE;
Y2 := TRUE;

// Logic to detect car at entry/exit and set the Mx variables for one scan cycle
IF X1 THEN
    M1 := NOT M1;
    M2 := NOT M2;
END_IF;

IF X2 THEN
    M3 := NOT M3;
    M4 := NOT M4;
END_IF;

// Logic to detect car movement and control the traffic lights
// If a car is entering the passage from the ground floor
IF M1 THEN
    M20 := TRUE;
    Y1 := TRUE;  // Turn Red lights ON
    Y2 := FALSE; // Turn Green lights OFF
END_IF;

// If a car is entering the passage from the basement
IF M2 THEN
    M30 := TRUE;
    Y1 := TRUE;  // Turn Red lights ON
    Y2 := FALSE; // Turn Green lights OFF
END_IF;

// Reset passage control signals once the car has passed
IF M3 THEN
    M20 := FALSE; // Passage clear from ground floor to basement
END_IF;

IF M4 THEN
    M30 := FALSE; // Passage clear from basement to ground floor
END_IF;

// Enable Green lights when the passage is clear
// Both M20 and M30 FALSE means the passage is clear
IF NOT M20 AND NOT M30 THEN
    Y1 := FALSE; // Turn Red lights OFF
    Y2 := TRUE;  // Turn Green lights ON
END_IF;
```

This ST program follows the logic described in the requirements:
- It listens for activations at the photoelectric switches (X1 and X2) to detect car movements. 
- It uses intermediate variables (M1 to M4) to track the position of the car during one scan cycle.
- The program engages either M20 or M30 when a car moves through the entry/exit, depending on the direction.
- Finally, it controls the Red (Y1) and Green (Y2) lights to safely manage the cars' movement in and out of the underground car park.

Note that this example assumes the PLC is adequately set to handle single cycle activation for M1 to M4. Further refinement might be required depending on the physical setup and response times of the hardware components involved.
