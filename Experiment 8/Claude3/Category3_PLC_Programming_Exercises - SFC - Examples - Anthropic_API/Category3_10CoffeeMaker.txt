(End of Sequential Function Chart)
```

This sequential function chart represents the operation of the coffee machine based on the provided requirements. It includes the following steps:

1. The machine starts in the initial state.
2. Pressing Button2 initiates the selection process.
3. If Button3 is pressed (Coffee and Milk):
   - Open the coffee and milk valves to fill the mixer tank.
   - When the mixer tank reaches the maximum level, close the valves.
   - Start the mixer timer for 4 seconds.
   - After the mixing is complete, open the output valve to dispense the coffee.
   - When the mixer tank reaches the minimum level, return to the selection state.
4. If Button4 is pressed (Coffee only):
   - Open the coffee valve to fill the mixer tank.
   - When the mixer tank reaches the maximum level, close the coffee valve.
   - Start the mixer timer for 4 seconds.
   - After the mixing is complete, open the output valve to dispense the coffee.
   - When the mixer tank reaches the minimum level, return to the selection state.
5. If Button1 (Emergency Stop) is pressed at any point, the machine immediately halts and enters the EmergencyStop state.

Note: The transitions and actions are represented using ASCII art, and the specific syntax may need to be adapted to the actual IEC 61131-3 programming environment.
