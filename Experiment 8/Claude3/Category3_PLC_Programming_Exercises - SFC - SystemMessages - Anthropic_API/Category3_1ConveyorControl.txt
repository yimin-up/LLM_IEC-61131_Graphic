S1: Initial Step
    Automatically start conveyor
    Set conveyor speed to 2 m/s
    Transition to Conveyor Running

Conveyor Running:
    If any stop button pressed (Station1_Stop OR Station2_Stop OR Station3_Stop)
        Transition to S2a
    Else If Sensor1 AND Sensor2 AND Sensor3 AND Sensor4 AND Sensor5
        Transition to S2b  

S2a: 
    Stop conveyor
    Transition to Conveyor Stopped

S2b:
    Maintain conveyor speed at 2 m/s 
    Transition to S3b

S3a:
    Transition to Conveyor Stopped 

S3b: 
    If any stop button pressed
        Transition to S4a
    Else If Sensor1 AND Sensor2 AND Sensor3 AND Sensor4 AND Sensor5
        Transition to S4b

S4a:
    Transition to Conveyor Stopped

S4b:
    If any stop button pressed 
        Transition to S5a
    Else If NOT (Sensor1 AND Sensor2 AND Sensor3 AND Sensor4 AND Sensor5)
        Transition to S5b

S5a: 
    Transition to Conveyor Stopped

S5b:
    Transition to Conveyor Running

Conveyor Stopped:
    Transition to S6

S6: Final Step
