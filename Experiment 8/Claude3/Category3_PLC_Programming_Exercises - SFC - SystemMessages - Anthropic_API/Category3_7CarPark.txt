       RETURN

This SFC program follows the IEC 61131-3 standard and meets the given requirements:

1. The initial step sets the green lights (Y2) ON and red lights (Y1) OFF.
2. When a car enters from the ground floor (M1=ON), the red lights turn ON, green lights turn OFF, and M20 is set to indicate a car is in the passage.
3. The system waits for the car to pass through to the basement (M4=ON), then turns the green lights back ON, red lights OFF, and resets M20.
4. Similarly, when a car enters from the basement (M3=ON), the red lights turn ON, green lights turn OFF, and M30 is set.
5. The system waits for the car to pass through to the ground floor (M2=ON), then turns the green lights back ON, red lights OFF, and resets M30.
6. The program returns to the initial step, allowing the cycle to repeat.
