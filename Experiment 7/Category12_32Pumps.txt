Given the complexity of combining conditions in ladder logic, we breakdown the Sequential Function Chart's processes into understandable ladder diagram elements based directly on the conditions and actions described. Here's the equivalent ladder diagram:

|       HL      LL                  P1_Start    |
+------|/|-----|/|-----+-----------( )----------+
|                       |                       |
|       LL      HL      |                       |
+------| |-----| |-----+                       |
|                                              |
|       HL     NOT LL                          |
|      AND     AND  NOT HL    P1_Stop          |
+------| |-----|/|-----|/|-----( )-------------+

+-------|/|-----|/|-----+-----------( )--------+
|                        |                     |

Each condition and operation from SFC is translated into its ladder logic equivalent:

- Conditions are represented as normally open (| |) or normally closed (|/|) contact symbols in the ladder diagram.
- Logical operations (AND, NOT) are represented by the arrangement and type of contacts in series or parallel.
- Actions like starting or stopping pumps (StartP1, StopP1, StartP2) are represented as coils ().
- Sequential conditions and branches in the SFC are converted to parallel paths in the ladder diagram.

This ladder layout provides a direct and logical representation, fitting the IEC 61131-3 standards for PLC programming, where logical conditions control the execution of actions (like starting or stopping pumps) based on the combination of high-level (HL) and low-level (LL) signals.
