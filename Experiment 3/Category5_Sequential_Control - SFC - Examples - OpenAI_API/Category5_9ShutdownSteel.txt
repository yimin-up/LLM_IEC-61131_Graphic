To create a structured approach for the controlled shut-down of a steel production facility, let's first outline the steps, then focus on a specific range of steps for a detailed control narrative, and finally create Sequential Function Chart programs according to IEC 61131-3 standard for specific tasks related to furnace operation during shut-down.

### Steps for Controlled Shut-Down of a Steel Production Facility:
1. **Notification of Intent to Shut Down**: Inform all operational staff of the planned shut-down.
2. **Securing Raw Material Supply**: Stop the supply of raw materials to the facility.
3. **Completion of Ongoing Processes**: Allow ongoing processes to complete their current cycles.
4. **Gradual Reduction of Furnace Operations**: Reduce the furnace temperature and fuel gas flow.
5. **Adjustment of Oxygen Supply**: Adjust oxygen supply to maintain optimal combustion conditions.
6. **Powering Down Equipment**: Sequentially power down processing and auxiliary equipment.
7. **Safety Inspections**: Conduct final safety inspections to ensure all systems are off and secure.
8. **Documentation**: Log all shut-down activities and any unusual occurrences.

### Detailed Control Narrative for Steps 4 to 6:
- **Step 4 (Gradual Reduction of Furnace Operations):** Over a period of 12 hours, the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners should be reduced from its operational level of 100% to a minimum safe operating level of 10%. This gradual reduction should be linear, with checkpoints every hour to reduce the flow by approximately 7.5% of the initial flow rate.
- **Step 5 (Adjustment of Oxygen Supply):** During the reduction of the fuel gas flow rate, the oxygen supply to the burners needs to be adjusted to maintain a fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5. This ensures that combustion is efficient and minimizes the production of harmful emissions. The control system should continuously monitor and adjust the oxygen flow rate based on real-time measurements of the fuel gas flow rate.
- **Step 6 (Powering Down Equipment):** Once the fuel gas flow rate has reached the minimum safe operating level and the material inside the furnace has been processed, begin the sequential shut-down of other processing equipment, starting with those most critical to the operation and ending with auxiliary systems such as lighting and ventilation.
