Your task is to write IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programs according to the requirements delimited by triple quotes.
'''
Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should control the flow of air to actuators based on input signals to 50 standard liters per minute, and maintain a pressure range of 5.5 to 6 bar.

To create a Structured Text program for controlling a pneumatic system as per your specifications, we need to consider the following elements:

Timing: A control loop frequency of 100 ms.
Control Objective: Regulating the flow of air to actuators to 50 standard liters per minute.
Pressure Range: Maintaining a pressure range between 5.5 to 6 bar.
The program will be structured as follows:

Variables: For input signals, actuator control, flow rate measurement, and pressure measurement.
Timing Control: Implementing a 100 ms cycle for the control loop.
Control Logic: Algorithms to adjust the flow and maintain the pressure within the specified range.
Here's an example of how this program might look in Structured Text, compliant with IEC 61131-3:

```iec
PROGRAM PneumaticSystemControl
VAR
    inputSignal : BOOL;  // Signal to start the flow
    actuatorControl : BOOL; // Control signal for actuator
    flowRate : REAL; // Flow rate in standard liters per minute
    pressure : REAL; // Pressure in bar
    timer : TON; // Timer for control loop
END_VAR

// Initialize the timer with a PT of 100ms
timer(IN := FALSE, PT := T#100ms);

// Main control loop
IF inputSignal THEN
    timer.IN := TRUE; // Start the timer
    IF timer.Q THEN
        // Control logic for the actuator
        actuatorControl := TRUE; // Activate actuator

        // Read current flow rate and pressure
        flowRate := ReadFlowRate();
        pressure := ReadPressure();

        // Adjust flow rate to 50 liters/min
        IF flowRate <> 50 THEN
            AdjustFlowRate(50);
        END_IF

        // Maintain pressure between 5.5 to 6 bar
        IF pressure < 5.5 THEN
            IncreasePressure();
        ELSIF pressure > 6 THEN
            DecreasePressure();
        END_IF

        timer.IN := FALSE; // Reset the timer
    END_IF
ELSE
    actuatorControl := FALSE; // Deactivate actuator
    timer.IN := FALSE; // Stop the timer
END_IF
```

Note:

ReadFlowRate, AdjustFlowRate, ReadPressure, IncreasePressure, and DecreasePressure are assumed to be external functions or procedures that handle specific hardware interactions. They need to be defined according to the specific hardware and sensors used in your system.
This example assumes that you have a mechanism to read the flow rate and pressure, and actuators that can adjust these parameters. The control logic might need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of your hardware.
