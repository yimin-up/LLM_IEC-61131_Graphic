Implementing a cascade control system for temperature regulation in a heat exchanger using Ladder Diagram according to IEC 61131-3 standards can be complex due to the nature of cascade control systems, typically involving two controllers where one acts as the primary (master) and the other as a secondary (slave). The master controls a setpoint for the slave controller to achieve, regulating the primary process variable, while the slave subsequently controls a secondary process variable affecting the primary one. For simplicity, the PLC program will manage the temperature by adjusting a heating element based on the temperature feedback.

Here's an ASCII art representation of a simplified conceptual Ladder Diagram for a cascade control system managing a heat exchanger's temperature. This example focuses on the basic logic for temperature control rather than the full detail of cascade dynamics:

|                                                                                 |
|              /----[Flow Control Valve]----\                                      |
|              | TargetFlowRate             |                                      |

|                                                                             |

In this diagram:
- **PID 1 (Master Control)**: Manages the overall process by maintaining the temperature. It takes the actual temperature (`ActualTemp`) as a process variable (PV), comparing it with the desired temperature (`DesiredTemp`) to generate a manipulated variable (MV), which is the `TargetFlowRate` for the coolant or heating medium in the exchanger. This flow rate is used as a setpoint for the secondary control level.
- **[Heater Control]**: This is a simplified representation where **PID 2** controls the heating based on the temperature discrepancy. `CurrentTemp` from a sensor is the process variable, and the `Setpoint` is derived from **PID 1**'s output. The output controls the `Heater` to maintain the temperature.
- **[Flow Control Valve]**: Illustrates the action taken based on PID 1's output to adjust the flow of the heating or cooling medium.

Note: Actual implementation would critically depend on PID function block configurations available within the PLC programming environment and specific hardware configuration details which can't be fully represented in ASCII art.
