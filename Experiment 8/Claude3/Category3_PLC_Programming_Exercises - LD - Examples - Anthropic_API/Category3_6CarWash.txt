Explanation:
1. The first rung detects if a car is present (CarSensor) and no human is detected (HumanSensor) to set the WashActive flag.
2. The second rung resets the WashActive flag if a human is detected while washing is active.
3. The third rung is a self-holding circuit to maintain the WashActive flag once set.
4. The fourth rung resets the WashActive flag when washing is completed.
5. The fifth rung uses a TON (On-Delay) timer to define the wash duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
6. The sixth rung starts the WashMotor when WashActive is set.
7. The seventh rung stops the WashMotor when WashActive is reset.
8. The eighth rung activates the Alarm if a human is detected during the wash process.
9. The ninth rung resets the Alarm when the human is no longer detected.

This Ladder Diagram program should control the automatic car wash station based on the presence of a car and the absence of humans in the wash area, and it will trigger an alarm if a human is detected during the wash process.
