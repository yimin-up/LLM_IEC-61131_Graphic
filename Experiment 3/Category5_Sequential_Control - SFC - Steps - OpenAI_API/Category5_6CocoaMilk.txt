### Step 1:#### Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Sequential Function Chart.

Inputs:
- `StartButton`: Boolean input to start the batch process.
- `TempSensor`: Temperature sensor in the vessel, in degrees Celsius.
- `MilkAdded`: Boolean indicating completion of milk addition.
- `WaterAdded`: Boolean indicating completion of water addition.
- `SugarAdded`: Boolean indicating completion of liquid sugar addition.
- `CocoaAdded`: Boolean indicating completion of cocoa addition.
- `MixingComplete`: Boolean indicating mixing is complete.
- `HeatingComplete`: Boolean indicating heating to target temperature is complete.

Outputs:
- `ValveMilk`: Control signal to open/close milk valve.
- `ValveWater`: Control signal to open/close water valve.
- `ValveSugar`: Control signal to open/close liquid sugar valve.
- `ValveCocoa`: Control signal to open/close cocoa valve.
- `MixerMotor`: Control signal to start/stop the mixing motor.
- `Heater`: Control signal to turn on/off the heater.

#### Step 2:#### Briefly describe the state machine of the requirements.

1. **Initialization**: Ensure all valves are closed, and the mixing motor and heater are off.
2. **Addition of Ingredients**: Sequentially add milk, water, liquid sugar, and cocoa. Each ingredient must be added only after the previous one is fully dispensed.
3. **Mixing**: Once all ingredients are in the vessel, start the mixing motor.
4. **Heating**: While mixing, heat the mixture to a target temperature sufficient for cocoa milk production (e.g., 80¡ãC).
5. **Completion**: Once the mixture has reached the target temperature and mixing is deemed complete, stop all operations and signal the completion of the batch.

#### Step 3:#### Give the Sequential Function Chart program in ASCII art.

#### Step 4:#### Explain the purpose of each step, action, and transition.

- **Initialize:** Closes all valves, turns off the mixer motor and heater to prepare for a new batch.
- **Add Milk/Water/Sugar/Cocoa:** Opens the respective valve for each ingredient, waits until the addition is complete (as indicated by the respective boolean inputs), then closes the valve.
    - **Transitions**: From initialize to add milk, and subsequently from each ingredient addition to the next, are conditioned upon the completion of the prior step.
- **Mix:** Turns on the mixer motor to combine ingredients thoroughly.
- **Heat:** Activates the heater while mixing to reach the target temperature of the mixture.
- **Complete:** Once the desired temperature is reached, and mixing is complete, all operations stop and the process is marked as complete.

#### Step 5:#### Check the SFC you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

The Sequential Function Chart (SFC) designed follows the IEC 61131-3 standard for structuring control logic in PLC programming:

- **Stages and Steps are Clearly Defined:** Each action (ingredient addition, mixing, heating) is distinctly outlined as a step.
- **Transitions are Condition-Based:** The flow from one step to the next is controlled by specific condition checks (e.g., ingredient added, target temperature reached), as per SFC conventions.
- **Input and Output Actions are Associated with Steps:** Each step specifically activates the required outputs (valves, mixer, heater) and monitors the respective inputs for progressing through the batch process.
- **Sequential Logic:** The logic flow is sequential and mirrors a typical batch process in manufacturing, starting with initialization, processing (ingredient addition, mixing, heating), and ending with process completion.

This SFC layout and logic align with IEC 61131-3 guidelines for structured control and automation processes, ensuring clarity, reliability, and maintainability of the program.
