Given the task of creating a self-contained 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for the sequential control part of step B.2, "Reaction," in an ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production, let's walk through the steps:

### Step 1:#### Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Sequential Function Chart.

- **Inputs:**
  - `Start_Reaction`: Boolean signal to start the reaction process.
  - `Temp_Reached`: Boolean signal indicating that the required temperature has been reached.
  - `Mixing_Done`: Boolean signal indicating that the mixing process is complete.
  - `Reaction_Time_Elapsed`: Boolean signal from a timer indicating that the reaction time has elapsed.
- **Outputs:**
  - `Heat_On`: Boolean signal to activate heating.
  - `Mixer_On`: Boolean signal to activate the mixer.
  - `Next_Step`: Boolean signal to move to the next step in the process sequence.

### Step 2:#### Briefly describe the state machine of the requirements.

The state machine for the "Reaction" step in the adhesive production process includes the following states:
1. **Start:** Waiting for the process to start.
2. **Heating:** Heating up the mixture to a required temperature.
3. **Mixing:** Activating the mixer to mix ingredients thoroughly after reaching the required temperature.
4. **Reacting:** Maintaining the conditions for the chemical reaction to occur.
5. **Done:** Completing the reaction process and preparing for the next step.

Transitions between the states are triggered by the inputs, such as reaching the required temperature, completing the mixing, and the reaction time elapsing.

### Step 3:#### Give the Sequential Function Chart program in ASCII art.

```
    +--[Start]--+ 
    |           | 
    |           v
    |         (Start_Reaction)
    |           |
    +-->[Heating]--------------+
    |           |              |
    |     (Temp_Reached)       |
    |           |              |
    +-->[Mixing]---------+     |
    |           |        |     |
    |  (Mixing_Done)     |     |
    |           |        |     |
    +-->[Reacting]       |     |
                |        |     |
    (Reaction_Time_Elapsed)   |
                |        |     |
                |        |     |
                +->[Done]<----+
                      |
                      v
                  (Next_Step)
```

### Step 4:#### Explain the purpose of each step, action, and transition.

- **Start:** Awaiting the start of the reaction process. Once the `Start_Reaction` signal is received, the process moves to the Heating state.
- **Heating:** In this step, the `Heat_On` output is activated to heat the mixture. The transition to the next state occurs once the `Temp_Reached` input signal indicates the mixture has reached the required temperature.
- **Mixing:** The `Mixer_On` output is activated to mix the ingredients thoroughly. The process moves to the Reacting state after the `Mixing_Done` signal is received, indicating mixing is complete.
- **Reacting:** This state maintains the current conditions to allow the chemical reaction to occur. The transition to Done is triggered by the `Reaction_Time_Elapsed` signal.
- **Done:** This state represents the completion of the reaction process. The `Next_Step` output can be activated to proceed to the next process step.

Transitions between states are governed by conditions related to each state's completion, such as reaching temperature, mixing completion, and reaction time elapse.

### Step 5:#### Check the SFC you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

The provided Sequential Function Chart (SFC) adheres to the IEC 61131-3 standard as it clearly defines:
- Input and output signals that drive the reactions and transitions between the steps.
- The flow from one step to another, ensuring a logical and sequential execution of tasks.
- Conditions for transitions that are specific and directly related to the process parameters.

The SFC structure, with its steps, actions, and transitions, meets the requirements for controlling a process in a defined sequence, in this case, the "Reaction" step in adhesive production, thereby complying with IEC 61131-3 standards for PLC programming.
