Here's how the control logic works according to the chart:

- The system starts in the "Initial" (Stop) state. The motor is not running.
- When the Start button (StartBtn) is pressed (`+ StartBtn`), the system transitions to the "MotorOn" state.
  - In the "MotorOn" state, the system activates the Motor Start (Output) (`+------+ Motor Start (Output)`), causing the motor to run.
- When the Stop button (StopBtn) is pressed while in the "MotorOn" state (`+ StopBtn`), the system transitions back to the "Initial" state, stopping the motor.
