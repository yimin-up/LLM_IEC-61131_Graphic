Creating a control recipe in accordance with ISA-88 for the batch production of Polyvinylchloride (PVC) using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with IEC 61131-3 compliant Ladder Diagram (LD) programming involves several steps. We°Øll outline the control sequence for the stages of "Polymerize", "Decover", and "Dry" with specific operations.

### Start of Ladder Diagram Program

**1. Prepare Reactor**

Operation: Evacuate the reactor to remove oxygen.

**2. Charge Stage**

Operation: Add demineralized water and surfactants.

```

**3. React Stage**

Operations:
- Add vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and catalyst.
- Heat to 55 - 60°„C.
- Hold until the reactor pressure decreases.

### End of Ladder Diagram Program

This illustrative example abstracts the complex operations into simplified LD blocks, assuming that auxiliary functions (like temperature, pressure measurement, etc.) are managed appropriately according to the specified process conditions. In an actual implementation, each operation would be more detailed, including safety measures, precise control of material flows, and temperatures, as well as algorithms to ensure consistent product quality.
