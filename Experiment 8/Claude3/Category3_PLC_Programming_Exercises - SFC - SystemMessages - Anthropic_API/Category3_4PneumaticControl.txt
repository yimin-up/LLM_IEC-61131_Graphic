Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart program to control the pneumatic system per your requirements:

  Action1:
    FLOW_SP := 50.0;  // Set flow setpoint to 50 standard liters/min
    PRESSURE_MIN := 5.5;  // Set minimum pressure to 5.5 bar 
    PRESSURE_MAX := 6.0;  // Set maximum pressure to 6.0 bar
    START_CONTROL;
    
  Action2:  
    ADJUST_FLOW_DOWN;
    
  Action3:
    ADJUST_FLOW_UP;
    
  T1: t#100ms // Transition time 100ms
  T2: t#100ms
  
  IN1: SYSTEM_ENABLE // Input to enable system
  FLOW_OK: (FLOW >= (FLOW_SP - 1.0)) & (FLOW =< (FLOW_SP + 1.0)) // Check if flow is within +/- 1 liter of setpoint
  PRESSURE_OK: (PRESSURE >= PRESSURE_MIN) & (PRESSURE =< PRESSURE_MAX) // Check if pressure is in range

This SFC controls the pneumatic system in a loop executing every 100ms when enabled via the IN1 input. 

In the initial step S1, it sets the flow setpoint to 50 l/min, pressure range to 5.5-6.0 bar and starts control.

If flow is outside the +/- 1 l/min deadband around the setpoint, it transitions to step S11 and calls ADJUST_FLOW_DOWN to decrease flow. 

If flow is within the deadband, it transitions to step S12 and calls ADJUST_FLOW_UP to increase flow.

The PRESSURE_OK interlock ensures pressure stays within the 5.5 to 6.0 bar range.
