> Write a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program, not a function block, to control a pneumatic system with a control loop frequency of 100 ms. The system should control the flow of air to actuators based on input signals to 50 standard liters per minute, and maintain a pressure range of 5.5 to 6 bar.

Creating a self-contained Ladder Diagram using ASCII art based on IEC 61131-3 standard for a pneumatic system that controls air flow to actuators with a requirement of 50 standard liters per minute, and maintaining a pressure of 5.5 to 6 bar follows. This abstract example assumes the existence of:

- An input for pressure measurement `PressureSensor`.
- Outputs to control a solenoid valve for air inflow `ValveOpen` and another for release `ValveClose`.
- A timer to ensure the control loop frequency of 100 ms.
- Inputs or setpoints indicating the desired flow rate and pressure are considered as constants since providing actual feedback mechanism or flow sensors' management is complex and could vary greatly depending on the system design specifics.

Given there's no direct way to simulate precise timing or feedback mechanisms in ASCII Ladder Diagram representation, especially for managing flows and pressures in such a precise manner, we'll focus on depicting an abstract control loop that would be logically expected to handle such tasks. Improvements and specific implementations will depend on the actual PLC hardware, available sensors, and actuators' capabilities.

Key Interpretations:
- The control starts with checking the timer to keep the loop at 100ms.
- "PressureSensor < 5.5 bar" is hypothetical logic to represent reading a pressure sensor and deciding if the pressure is less than 5.5 bar, after which it would activate the solenoid valve labeled `ValveOpen` to increase pressure.
- Conversely, if the "PressureSensor >= 6 bar" logic denoted it reads 6 bar or more, it would trigger the `ValveClose` valve to stop inflow and reduce pressure.
- There's an abstract assumption here that the opening and closing of valves would regulate the system in a way that meets the flow requirements indirectly, given pump and system characteristics that can provide at least 50 standard liters per minute within the pressure range specified.
- This diagram does not specify how pressure is regulated between 5.5 and 6 bar specifically for fine control nor does it detail how flow is directly measured or controlled, given the high level and generic nature of this request.
- Real implementation would significantly depend on sensor feedback, variable-frequency drive (VFD) pump control (if applied), or variable valve positions, none of which are detailed explicitly here.

Fine-tuning would require integrating real sensor feedback, PID control loops for pressure and possibly flow rate control, and precise actuator control, which is hard to demonstrate accurately in a generic ASCII ladder diagram format, and would typically involve more detailed programming constructs found in Function Block Diagram (FBD) or Structured Text (ST) programming.
