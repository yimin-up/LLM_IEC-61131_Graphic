To design a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for implementing PID feedback control for the pressure in a chemical reactor, you should be familiar with several components beyond the SFC, including Function Blocks (FBs) for PID control as well as elements for reading and adjusting pressure. However, the textual representation (ASCII art) of an SFC here will focus on the main steps and transitions involved in maintaining the desired pressure using PID control.

Given the PID control, our main steps would be:

1. **Initialization**: Configuring initial settings for PID controllers, sensors, actuators, etc.
2. **Read Pressure**: Measuring the current pressure in the reactor.
3. **Compute PID**: Calculating the necessary adjustments using PID control logic.
4. **Adjust Pressure**: Adjusting the reactor's pressure (e.g., by controlling a valve).
5. **Monitoring**: Checking for system stability and safety thresholds.

This control loop will continuously cycle through reading the pressure, computing PID adjustments, and making corrections, with the ability to initialize once at the start or upon reset, and monitor for any conditions that require emergency shutdowns or system alerts.

Below is a simplified ASCII representation of an SFC for this control loop. Note that in a practical scenario, each of these steps would be linked with detailed programming of each Function Block (like PID control, analog input reading, and output handling), which are beyond the direct illustration capability of simple ASCII art or textual explanations.

```
            +-------------+
            | Initialization  |
            +------+------+
                   |
                   |
    +--------------v-------------+
    |            Read Pressure            |
    +--------------+-------------+
                   |
    +--------------v-------------+
    |           Compute PID                   |
    +--------------+-------------+
                   |
    +--------------v-------------+
    |         Adjust Pressure            |
    +--------------+-------------+
                   |
                   +----------------+
                   |                              |
    +--------------v-------------+    +------v-------+
    |            Monitoring               |    | System Stable?  |
    +--------------+-------------+    +------+-------+
                   |                      No | Yes
                   |                       +----+
                   |                          |
                   +--------------------------+
```

In this representation:
- Arrows (`v`, `+`, `|`) signify the flow and transitions between steps.
- "System Stable?" might represent a decision point or transition condition based on specific criteria, for example, if the system is not within acceptable parameters, it might cycle through the adjustment and monitoring phase again.

In an actual IEC 61131-3 development environment, each step might be associated with actions written in one of the PLC programming languages defined by the standard (e.g., Ladder Diagram, Structured Text, Function Block Diagram), and transitions could be based on conditions evaluated from sensor readings or internal computations.

Remember, this textual representation merely sketches the SFC's logical flow. Each of these steps would need to be fleshed out with the specific IEC 61131-3 code blocks (FBs, LDs, etc.) that implement detailed PID control logic, read and write operations, and any necessary safety or control checks.
