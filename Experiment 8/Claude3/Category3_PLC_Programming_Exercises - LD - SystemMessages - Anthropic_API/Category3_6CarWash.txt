Here's an IEC 61131-3 compliant Ladder Diagram (LD) program for an automatic car wash station with the given requirements:

I  - Car presence sensor
S1 - Car wash station 1 sensor
S2 - Car wash station 2 sensor
H  - Human presence sensor
A  - Alarm output
W  - Car wash motor
M  - Car wash motor contactor
TON - On-delay timer
TOF - Off-delay timer
```

Explanation:
1. The car presence sensor (I) detects if a car is present at the car wash station.
2. The car wash station sensors (S1 and S2) ensure that the car is properly positioned in the car wash area.
3. The human presence sensor (/H) is normally closed and detects if a human is present in the car wash area. The "/" symbol represents a normally closed contact.
4. If a car is detected (I), properly positioned (S1 and S2), and no human is present (/H), the on-delay timer (TON) is triggered with a preset time (PT) of 5 seconds.
5. After the 5-second delay, the car wash motor (W) is activated, which in turn activates the car wash motor contactor (M) to start the washing process.
6. If a human is detected (/H) or an alarm condition (/A) occurs during the washing process, the car wash motor (W) is immediately stopped, and the off-delay timer (TOF) is triggered with a preset time (PT) of 2 seconds.
7. After the 2-second delay, the alarm output (A) is activated to alert the operator about the presence of a human or an alarm condition.

Note: This is a simplified representation of the Ladder Diagram, and additional safety measures, interlocks, and error handling may be required in a real-world implementation.
