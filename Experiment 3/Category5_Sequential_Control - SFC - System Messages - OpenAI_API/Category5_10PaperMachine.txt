Given the detailed requirement and the specified context of implementing a startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, a simplified sequence can be laid out with typical parameters. Since real paper machines can be quite complex, with many interdependent subsystems, this example will focus on a simplified version of a startup sequence for the press section. This example assumes some typical systems and parameters involved in their operation, focusing on temperature control, moisture levels, and mechanical components synchronization.

### Simplified Press Section Startup Sequence:
1. **Initial Checks**: Ensure that all emergency stops are reset and there are no active fault conditions.
2. **Temperature Ramp-Up**: Gradually increase the temperature of the press rolls to the target operational level.
    - Target Temperature: 95°„C
    - Ramp-Up Rate: 2°„C/min
3. **Moisture Control Activation**: Activate moisture control systems to reach the desired moisture level for the paper.
    - Target Moisture: 7%
4. **Press Section Activation**: Gradually apply mechanical pressure on the rolls to start the pressing process.
    - Target Pressure: 350 bar
    - Ramp-Up Time: 5 minutes
5. **Synchronization**: Ensure that the press section is synchronized with both the forming and drying sections.
6. **Operational Checks**: Perform operational checks to ensure all systems are within normal parameters.
7. **Start Signal**: Send a start signal to indicate that the press section is now fully operational.

Here is a simplified IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program that might control such a startup sequence, represented in ASCII art:

**Notes:**
- This ASCII diagram represents a straightforward sequence without accounting for branches or error handling for simplicity. In a real-world application, additional steps for error checking, alternative paths for fault conditions, and more complex synchronization logic might be necessary.
- The specific "actions" within each step (such as "Check E-Stops & Faults" or "Increase Temp to 95°„C @ 2 °„C/min") would be implemented in the action blocks associated with each step in a real SFC, using other IEC 61131-3 languages like Structured Text (ST) or Function Block Diagram (FBD) for the detailed logic.
- Actual systems would require detailed configuration of the parameters (e.g., PID controller settings for temperature and moisture control) and precise sensor and actuator interfaces, which are not detailed in this high-level overview.
