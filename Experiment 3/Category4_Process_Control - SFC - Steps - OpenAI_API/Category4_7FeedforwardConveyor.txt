To fulfill the requirements of implementing a feedforward control system for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-based predicted load using the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) approach, we will proceed through the outlined steps.

### Step 1:####
The system's inputs and outputs for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on the predicted load need to be defined as follows:

**Inputs:**
- PredictedLoad: A value provided by a sensor system that predicts the load on the conveyor belt.
- Start: A boolean signal to start the process.

**Outputs:**
- ConveyorSpeed: A signal to adjust the speed of the conveyor belt.

### Step 2:####
The state machine for this process will consist of the following states:

1. **StartState:** The initial state where the system awaits a start signal.
2. **ReadLoad:** State where the predicted load from sensors is read.
3. **AdjustSpeed:** Based on the predicted load, the conveyor belt speed is adjusted.
4. **Operate:** The conveyor operates at the adjusted speed.
5. **Stop:** A condition to stop the process, not necessarily defined by an input but included for completeness.

Transitions between these states are based on the completion of actions within each state, and in case of the StartState, also on the external input signal.

### Step 3:####
Now, the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program presented in ASCII art for visual understanding:

```
          +------+   +----------+   +------------+   +---------+   
 Start ---->| Start |-->| ReadLoad |-->| AdjustSpeed |-->| Operate |----+   
          +------+   +----------+   +------------+   +---------+   |    
                           ^                                     |    
                           |                                     |    
                           +-------------------------------------+    
```

### Step 4:####
**Purpose of each step, action, and transition:**

1. **Start:** 
   - Action: Await the `Start` signal.
   - Transition: Proceeds to `ReadLoad` upon receiving the `Start` signal.

2. **ReadLoad:** 
   - Action: Read the value of `PredictedLoad`.
   - Transition: Proceeds to `AdjustSpeed` immediately after reading the value.

3. **AdjustSpeed:**
   - Action: Calculate and set `ConveyorSpeed` based on `PredictedLoad`.
   - Transition: Proceeds to `Operate` after adjusting the speed.

4. **Operate:**
   - Action: Continue operation at the set `ConveyorSpeed`.
   - Transition: Loop back to `ReadLoad` to continuously adjust speed based on load; this could be time-triggered or event-triggered (not explicitly defined, assumes continuous operation).

### Step 5:####
Checking the SFC based on the IEC 61131-3 standard:

- **Organization and Clarity:** The SFC is organized into clear, distinct steps and transitions which closely follow the expected sequence of a feedforward control system for a conveyor belt.
- **Compliance with IEC 61131-3:** The SFC uses states (steps) and transitions as per the standard's requirements for Sequential Function Charts. Each step performs a single action or evaluates a condition, and transitions are based on conditions being met (e.g., the `Start` signal for the initial transition).
- **Inputs and Outputs:** Inputs (`PredictedLoad`, `Start`) and an output (`ConveyorSpeed`) are defined and used as required for the control process. Their use within the states fits the model of reading inputs, processing data, and setting outputs accordingly.
- **Transition and Flow:** The flow from one state to another is logical and ensures that the conveyor belt speed is adjusted based on the load, adhering to the concept of feedforward control. The circular transition from `Operate` back to `ReadLoad` suggests continuous monitoring and adjustment, fitting for dynamic load conditions.

This SFC meets the criteria set by the IEC 61131-3 standard for designing a control sequence and is tailored to meet the specified requirements for a conveyor belt speed adjustment based on a sensor-predicted load.
