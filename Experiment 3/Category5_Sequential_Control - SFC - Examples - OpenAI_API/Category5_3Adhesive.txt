For an ISA-88 based batch control system focused on adhesive production, let's define a simplified version of what a recipe might look like, focusing primarily on one of the steps: "B.2 Reaction". 

**ISA-88 Recipe for Adhesive Production**

- **Phase A: Preparation**
  1. Material Charging
  2. Premix

- **Phase B: Production**
  1. Transfer
  2. **Reaction**
  3. Cooling

- **Phase C: Finishing**
  1. Additives Introduction
  2. Final Mix
  3. Discharge

For the **B.2 Reaction** step, we are going to write a concise Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program compliant with IEC 61131-3 standards, focusing on the reaction process with timers and process parameters.

**IEC 61131-3 SFC for B.2 Reaction Step:**

Key:
- (State) or [Action] are steps in the SFC.
- T1, T2, T3 represent timer conditions or process conditions to transition to the next step.
- V represents sensor or condition checks.

Actions and Conditions:
- HeatUp: Activate heating system to reach the reaction temperature (e.g., 90¡ãC).
- MaintainTemp: Keep the temperature at 90¡ãC for the reaction to occur.
- CoolDown: Activate cooling system to lower the temperature to a safe handling level (e.g., 45¡ãC).

Timers and Parameters:
- T1 (HeatUp Time): Time required to reach 90¡ãC, let's say 30 minutes.
- T2 (Reaction Time): Maintain 90¡ãC for the reaction duration, assumed to be 2 hours.
- T3 (CoolDown Time): Time to cool down to 45¡ãC, estimated as 45 minutes.

**Control Logic for B.2 Reaction:**
```iec
PROGRAM ReactionStep
VAR
    timer1: TON; // Timer for Heating up
    timer2: TON; // Timer for Maintaining Reaction Temperature
    timer3: TON; // Timer for Cooling Down
    heatingSystem: BOOL; // Heating system controller
    coolingSystem: BOOL; // Cooling system controller
    temperatureSensor: INT; // Simulated Temperature Sensor
    currentState: INT := 0; // Current Step Counter
END_VAR

CASE currentState OF
    0: // Initial State, Start Heating
        heatingSystem := TRUE;
        timer1(IN:=heatingSystem, PT:=T#30m); // Start heating timer          
        IF temperatureSensor >= 90 THEN
            currentState := 1; // Proceed to next state
            timer1(IN:=FALSE); // Stop Timer
        END_IF;
        
    1: // Maintain Reaction Temperature
        heatingSystem := FALSE; 
        timer2(IN:=TRUE, PT:=T#2h); // Start maintaining reaction temperature timer
        IF timer2.Q THEN
            currentState := 2; // Proceed to next state
            timer2(IN:=FALSE); // Stop Timer
        END_IF;
        
    2: // Start Cooling Down
        coolingSystem := TRUE;
        timer3(IN:=coolingSystem, PT:=T#45m); // Start cooling timer
        IF temperatureSensor <= 45 OR timer3.Q THEN
            currentState := 3; // Proceed to End state
            timer3(IN:=FALSE); // Stop Timer
            coolingSystem := FALSE; // Turn off Cooling System
        END_IF;
        
    3: // Process Ended
        // Reset all controls or setup for the next process    
END_CASE
```

This PLC program encapsulates the control logic for the "Reaction" step within adhesive production, including transitions based on timers corresponding to heating, maintaining the reaction temperature, and cooling based on predefined conditions.
