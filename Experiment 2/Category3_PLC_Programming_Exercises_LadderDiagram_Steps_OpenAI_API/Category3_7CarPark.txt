Step 1:####
Inputs:
- X1: Photoelectric switch at the ground floor entry/exit.
- X2: Photoelectric switch at the basement entry/exit.
- M1: ON for one scan when a car from the ground floor passes X1.
- M2: ON for one scan when a car from the basement passes X1.
- M3: ON for one scan when a car from the basement passes X2.
- M4: ON for one scan when a car from the ground floor passes X2.

Intermediate variables:
- M20: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the ground floor.
- M30: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the basement.

Outputs:
- Y1: Red lights at the entry/exit of both ground floor and basement.
- Y2: Green lights at the entry/exit of both ground floor and basement.

Standard symbols use (ASCII representation):
- Inputs (X1, X2, M1, M2, M3, M4) are represented by [--( )--] with their respective labels.
- Outputs (Y1, Y2) are represented by [--( )--] with their respective labels.
- Intermediate variables (M20, M30) are treated like internal coils and are represented by [--( )--].

Step 2:####
```
|--[X1]----[/]----[/]----[M20]--(M1)---|
|--[M1]---------------------------(Y1)--|
|--[/M20]--------------------------(Y2)--|
                     |
|--[X2]----[/]----[/]----[M30]--(M3)---|
|--[M3]---------------------------(Y1)--|
|--[/M30]--------------------------(Y2)--|
```

Step 3:####
For rung 1: If X1 (ground floor photoelectric switch) detects a car and none of the cars are passing through (M20 = OFF), then activate M1.
For rung 2: If M1 (car passing from ground floor) is detected, activate Y1 (turn ON red lights).
For rung 3: If no car is in the passage from the ground floor (M20 = OFF), keep Y2 ON (green lights ON).
(Similar logic applies to the basement section represented by inputs X2 and M3 for cars passing from the basement.)

Step 4:####
The state machine of this Ladder Diagram functions as follows:
- Initially, green lights are ON (Y2), and red lights are OFF (Y1).
- When a car is detected at the ground floor entrance (X1), the system checks if another car is currently passing; if not, it turns ON the red lights (Y1) for both the ground floor and basement and turns OFF the green lights (Y2).
- Similarly, the process works for a car detected at the basement entrance (X2) with the same logic applied through M3.
- Once a car passes through the passage, the intermediate variables M20/M30 reset to OFF, allowing the system to return to its initial state with green lights (Y2) ON and red lights (Y1) OFF.
- The system prohibits entry/exit when a car is passing through by keeping the red lights (Y1) ON and only allows passage again when the track is clear, indicated by the green lights (Y2) ON.
