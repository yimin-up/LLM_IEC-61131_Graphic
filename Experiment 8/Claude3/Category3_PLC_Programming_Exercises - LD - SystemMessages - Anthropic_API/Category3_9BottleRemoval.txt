Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program in ASCII art for the bottle packaging system you described:

Inputs:
- Bottle Detected: Proximity sensor that detects any bottle
- Empty Detected: Proximity sensor that detects only empty bottles

Outputs:
- Cylinder Extend: Output to extend the cylinder to remove empty bottles
- Cylinder Retract: Output to retract the cylinder

Functional Description:
1. When a bottle is detected by the "Bottle Detected" sensor, it enables the rung.
2. If the bottle is also detected as empty by the "Empty Detected" sensor, it triggers the cylinder extend output.
3. The cylinder extend output is maintained for a duration of 2 seconds using a TON (On-Delay) timer.
4. After the 2-second delay, the TOF (Off-Delay) timer is triggered, which maintains the cylinder retract output.
5. The cylinder retract output is maintained until the bottle is no longer detected by the "Bottle Detected" sensor.

This Ladder Diagram program ensures that when an empty bottle is detected, the cylinder extends to remove it from the conveyor. The cylinder remains extended for 2 seconds to allow sufficient time for removal. After the removal, the cylinder retracts and remains in that position until the next empty bottle is detected.
