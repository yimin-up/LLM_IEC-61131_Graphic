Certainly! Below is an example of a Structured Text (ST) program based on the IEC 61131-3 standard for a simple automatic car wash system in a PLC.

```iec
PROGRAM AutoCarWash
VAR
    CarDetected : BOOL;         // Input: Sensor to detect if a car is present
    HumanDetected : BOOL;       // Input: Sensor to detect if a human is present in the car wash area
    StartWash : BOOL;           // Output: Command to start the car wash process
    StopWash : BOOL;            // Output: Command to stop the car wash process
    Alarm : BOOL;               // Output: Alarm to signal the detection of a human
    WashingActive : BOOL;       // Internal flag to indicate the car wash is in progress
END_VAR

// Safety check first: Stop everything and raise alarm if a human is detected
IF HumanDetected THEN
    WashingActive := FALSE;
    StopWash := TRUE;
    Alarm := TRUE;
ELSE
    // Clear the alarm if no human is detected
    Alarm := FALSE;
    
    // Washing logic
    IF CarDetected AND NOT WashingActive THEN
        // No human detected and car is present so start washing
        StartWash := TRUE;
        WashingActive := TRUE;
    ELSIF NOT CarDetected THEN
        // No car detected, stop washing and reset the washing active flag
        StopWash := TRUE;
        WashingActive := FALSE;
    END_IF
END_IF

// Reset start/stop commands if needed
IF StartWash THEN
    StartWash := FALSE;
END_IF
IF StopWash THEN
    StopWash := FALSE;
END_IF
```

This code represents the core control logic for the car wash station. It needs to be called cyclically by the PLC's main loop.

Key notes about how this program works:

- `CarDetected` and `HumanDetected` are assumed to be inputs to the PLC from sensors. Depending on the actual implementation, these might be read from input registers or IO cards.
- `StartWash` and `StopWash` are outputs used to control relays or contactors that start or stop the wash process.
- `Alarm` is a boolean output that can be tied to an alarm system to alert operators or users of the station about a safety hazard.
- `WashingActive` is an internal flag used to maintain the state of whether a wash cycle is in progress or not.

In practice, there would be additional software layers to manage timers (for how long the wash takes), specific control of the wash sequence (pre-wash, soap, rinse, dry, etc.), and fault handling. An actual PLC implementation would also include interfacing with the physical IO, safety interlocks, and any communication with external monitoring systems.
