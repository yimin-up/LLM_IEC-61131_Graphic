**Explanation:**

*   **Start:** Initial step, transitions to either Manual Mode or Auto Mode based on the corresponding button press. 
*   **Manual Mode:**
    *   This step is active when the Manual button is pressed. 
    *   Transitions to the Clip step when the Clip button is pressed. 
    *   Transitions to the Idle step when the Auto button is pressed.
*   **Auto Mode:**
    *   This step is active when the Auto button is pressed.
    *   Transitions directly to the Clip step.
    *   Transitions to the Idle step when the Manual button is pressed.
*   **Clip:** 
    *   Activates the robot arm to clip the product from conveyor A.
    *   Transitions to the Transfer step in both Manual and Auto modes. 
*   **Transfer (2s):**
    *   Activates the robot arm to move the product to conveyor B. 
    *   This action has a 2-second delay implemented using a timer (not shown in the diagram).
    *   Transitions to the Release step in both Manual and Auto modes.
*   **Release:**
    *   Activates the robot arm to release the product onto conveyor B.
    *   Transitions to the Idle step in Auto mode.
    *   Remains in the Release step in Manual mode until the Release button is pressed, then transitions to the Idle step. 
*   **Idle:** 
    *   The robot arm remains idle in this step. 
    *   Transitions to Manual Mode or Auto Mode depending on the button pressed.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   Interlocking between Manual and Auto modes is implemented through the transitions. Only one mode can be active at a time.
*   The 2-second delay in the Transfer step can be implemented using a timer within the PLC program.
*   Additional safety checks and error handling routines can be added to the program as needed. 

**Implementation:**

This SFC diagram can be implemented in any IEC 61131-3 compliant PLC programming software using the respective function blocks and programming language elements for steps, transitions, and actions.
