    Notes: 

    - "Auto/Manual" is assumed to be a selector switch or a logic condition determining the mode.
    - Clip, Transfer, Release, AutoClip, AutoTransfer, and AutoRelease represent outputs to the robotic arm's mechanisms. 
    - External buttons or control logic conditions are assumed for Clip, Transfer, and Release in manual mode. 
    - The auto mode sequence is initiated by 'Auto' logic condition; 'AutoClip' activates automatically; followed by a 'Timer' for the transfer duration (2 seconds assumed here as "T#2s"); then 'AutoTransfer' logic and finally 'AutoRelease'.
    - "TimerDone" is a condition that is true when the timer has completed its countdown. This triggers 'AutoRelease'.
    - This diagram does not show safety and interlocking logic explicitly, which are crucial for real-world applications.
    
    This diagram simplifies complex logic for illustration purposes and might need adjustments based on specific application requirements, such as detailed handling of mode transitions and failure modes.
