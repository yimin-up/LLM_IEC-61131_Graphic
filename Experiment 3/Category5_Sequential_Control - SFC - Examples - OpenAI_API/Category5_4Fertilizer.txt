This program is highly simplified and focuses on the sequential logic for controlling the heating, cooling, and maintaining the pressure during the reaction stage of urea production. Each process parameter (like temperatures and pressure) is included as part of the steps, assuming there are additional logic blocks controlling the actuators based on these requirements.

For a real implementation, each step would encompass detailed logic for monitoring sensors, controlling actuators (valves, pumps, heaters, coolers), handling alarms, transitioning between steps based on process conditions, and ensuring safety and efficiency throughout the operation.
