Creating a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) for cascade control of temperature in a heat exchanger using ASCII art according to IEC 61131-3 standards involves several steps. In cascade control, we typically have two loops: a primary (master) loop that controls the main process variable (in this case, temperature) and a secondary (slave) loop that controls a secondary variable influencing the primary variable (like flow rate of the heating or cooling medium).

Since detailed implementation can vary based on specific process requirements, this ASCII-based SFC will outline a generic approach to achieve cascade control for the temperature in a heat exchanger:

### Description of Steps:
1. **Start_Heat_Exchanger**: The initial step where the process starts.
2. **Temperature_Control_Activation**: Activates the control system for temperature.
3. **Init_Temperature_Control**: Initializes parameters for temperature control, like setting up PID values.
4. **Check_Temperature_Setpoint**: Checks whether the temperature is within the desired setpoint range.
5. **Adjust_Temperature_Setpoint**: Adjusts the setpoint as needed based on process requirements.
6. **Monitor_Temperature_and_Adjust_Flow**: The core of the cascade control where the secondary loop adjusts the flow based on temperature feedback from the primary loop. This might involve dynamically adjusting PID parameters or setpoints.
7. **Hold_Temperature_Stable**: Maintains temperature stability once the setpoint is achieved.
8. **Error_Handling**: Captures any errors or anomalies in the process.
9. **Stop_Process**: Ends the process, usually upon reaching a stop condition or manually triggered.

Transitions between steps would be based on conditions related to temperature readings, setpoints, and flow rates, which are not expressed in this diagram but would be part of the condition blocks in a real SFC program.
