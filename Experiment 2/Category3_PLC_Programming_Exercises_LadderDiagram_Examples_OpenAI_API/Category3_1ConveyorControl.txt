Creating a comprehensive Ladder Diagram to control a conveyor belt system as per your specifications in ASCII form presents some limitations, as it doesn't convey the dynamic behaviors (like speed control in real-time, complex sensor interactions) and detailed settings (like configuring a specific speed for the conveyor belt) directly. However, I can provide a simplified version that captures the essence of your requirements focusing on the start/stop logic based on sensor inputs and user interactions across three stations.

Here¡¯s a simplified representation in ASCII:

Explanation:
- **Sensors 1 to 5**: These detect the presence of objects. If all are active, implying the belt is fully loaded, the conveyor should stop to avoid overflowing.
- **Start/Stop Stations 1 to 3 and Reset**: Each station allows a user to stop the conveyor. The reset buttons at each station symbolize that a user can reset the stop state caused by their respective station.
- **Conveyor Control Logic**: This is a simplified pseudocode representation. Actual implementation will involve setting up the conveyor motor control logic to start/stop based on the conditions stated, which are:
  - **Stop Conditions**: If all sensors detect objects or if any station's stop is activated, the conveyor stops.
  - **Start Conditions**: The conveyor starts if any station initiates a start command and none of the stop or reset conditions are met concurrently.

Actual speed control of 2 meters per second would require integrating this logic with your PLC's speed control function blocks or modules specifically designed for controlling motor speed.
