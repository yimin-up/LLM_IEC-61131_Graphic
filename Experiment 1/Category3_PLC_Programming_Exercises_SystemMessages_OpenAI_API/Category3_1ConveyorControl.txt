Given the requirements, it's necessary to use a structured approach to manage the conveyor belt system. The program needs to consider input from five sensors and control based on user interaction at three stations. The control logic for maintaining the conveyor belt speed is generally handled by a separate drive and control mechanism, so for the scope of this example, we'll focus on start/stop control based on sensor input and user commands.

The logic will include:
- 5 Boolean inputs representing the sensors (Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5)
- 3 Boolean inputs representing stop commands from the stations (StopStation1, StopStation2, StopStation3)
- 1 Boolean output to control the conveyor (ConveyorOn)

```pascal
PROGRAM ConveyorControl
VAR
    Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5: BOOL; // Sensors
    StopStation1, StopStation2, StopStation3: BOOL; // Stop buttons at stations
    ConveyorOn: BOOL; // Output to conveyor belt motor
END_VAR

VAR
    ObjectDetected: BOOL; // A flag to indicate if any object is detected
    StopRequested: BOOL; // A flag to indicate a stop request
END_VAR

// Initial setups or resets could be included here if necessary

BEGIN
    // Reset flags
    ObjectDetected := FALSE;
    StopRequested := FALSE;
    
    // Check for any object on the conveyor using sensors
    IF Sensor1 OR Sensor2 OR Sensor3 OR Sensor4 OR Sensor5 THEN
        ObjectDetected := TRUE;
    END_IF
    
    // Check if stop has been requested at any station
    IF StopStation1 OR StopStation2 OR StopStation3 THEN
        StopRequested := TRUE;
    END_IF
    
    // Control logic: Conveyor should run if there's an object and no stop requested
    ConveyorOn := ObjectDetected AND NOT StopRequested;
END_PROGRAM
```

This program continuously checks the input from the five sensors and the three stations. If any sensor detects an object (`ObjectDetected` is true) and no stop has been requested (`StopRequested` is false), the conveyor (`ConveyorOn`) is activated. If either no object is detected or a stop is requested, the conveyor will stop. 

Notice that we assume the conveyor belt's speed control (to maintain it at 2 meters per second) is managed externally, given the requirements. Additional details, like managing conveyor speed or adding further functionality, would require more complex logic and possibly hardware capabilities not outlined in this basic example.
