For a basic ISA-88 style batch recipe for producing 100kg of cocoa milk, let's outline the recipe and then move on to a simple programmable logic controller (PLC) ladder diagram program to control the mixing process using IEC 61131-3 standard.

### Recipe for 100kg of Cocoa Milk

#### Ingredients:
- Milk: 50 kg
- Water: 30 kg
- Liquid Sugar: 10 kg
- Cocoa Powder: 10 kg

#### Process:
1. Pre-mix - **Stir** at 30°C for 10 minutes
   - Start by adding water and milk into the vessel.
   - Stir the mixture gently to ensure an even blend.
2. Add Cocoa powder & Sugar - **Stir** at 40°C for 20 minutes
   - Gradually add cocoa powder and liquid sugar while stirring.
   - Temperature should gently rise to help in dissolving the cocoa and sugar.
3. Heat and mix - **Heat** to 60°C and **stir** for 30 minutes.
   - Increase the temperature to 60°C.
   - Continue stirring to ensure all ingredients are completely dissolved and mixed.

### IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram Program

For simplicity, let's assume the PLC is connected to:
- Inputs from temperature sensors (`TempSensor`), a start button (`StartBtn`), and a stop button (`StopBtn`).
- Outputs to control a heater (`Heater`), a mixer motor (`MixerMotor`).

This program represents a simplified view focused on managing temperature and mixing stages as outlined. It doesn't include detailed interlocks, safety conditions, or transitions between steps for brevity.

```plaintext
+----[ ]----+----[/]----+----( )----+
| StartBtn  |  StopBtn  |  MixerMotor |
+----[ ]----------------+----( )----+
| TempSensor < 30       |  Heater     |
+----[ ]----------------+----( )----+
| TempSensor >= 30 AND  |
| TempSensor < 60       |
|                       |  MixerMotor |
+----[ ]----------------+----( )----+
| TempSensor >= 60      |  Heater     |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

Explanation:
1. The mixer motor `MixerMotor` is turned on when the `StartBtn` is pressed unless the `StopBtn` is also pressed.
2. The `Heater` is activated if the `TempSensor` reads below 30°C to reach the pre-mix temperature.
3. Once reaching 30°C and below 60°C, the mixer motor `MixerMotor` continues to ensure thorough mixing.
4. If the temperature exceeds 60°C, the `Heater` is turned off to prevent overheating.

Note: This diagram and logic are very simplified and designed for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, the control logic would be far more complex, including safety checks, error handling, precise ingredient control, phased processing, and detailed interlocking for equipment safety.
