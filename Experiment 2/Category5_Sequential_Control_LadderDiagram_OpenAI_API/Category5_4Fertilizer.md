Creating an ISA-88 batch control recipe involves outlining the procedure and process control for a specific production batchâ€”in this case, urea fertilizer. ISA-88 is a standard for batch process control, providing a structured approach for designing, controlling, and documenting batch processes. Given the complex nature of urea production, which involves chemical reactions under specific conditions, we will focus on a simplified version that highlights the critical stages for heating, cooling, and pressure regulation during the reaction stage.

Below is an IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram to control heating, cooling, and pressure in the reactor for urea production. The process assumes there's a need to heat the mixture to a specific temperature to start the reaction, maintain pressure during the reaction, and then cool down the mixture afterward.

**Note:** For an actual implementation, more detailed control logic involving safety checks, alarms, and interlocks would be necessary. Values for temperatures and pressure are typical examples and must be adjusted based on real process requirements.

### Logic Overview
1. **Heating:** Heat until the reactor reaches the target reaction temperature.
2. **Pressure Regulation:** Maintain pressure within a specified range during the reaction.
3. **Cooling:** Cool the mixture down to a safe handling temperature once the reaction is complete.

### Explanation
- **Heating Phase:** The "HT" (Heater) turns on at the start of the process (`Start` trigger), heating the reactor until it reaches the target temperature (`TEMP` sensor compared to the target). 
- **Pressure Regulation:** The "PRESS SENSOR" continuously monitors the pressure within the reactor, ensuring it stays within a safe range. The system might adjust the heating or introduce more catalysts to regulate the pressure.
- **Cooling Phase:** After the reaction timer (`TIMER DONE`) signals the completion of the reaction phase, and assuming the pressure is within safe limits, the "COOL" mechanism is activated to bring the mixture to a safe handling temperature.

This simplified logic controls the crucial parameters during the urea fertilizer reaction phase. However, remember that real-world applications require integrating additional safety features, alarms, and possibly more complex control strategies to ensure process safety and efficiency.
