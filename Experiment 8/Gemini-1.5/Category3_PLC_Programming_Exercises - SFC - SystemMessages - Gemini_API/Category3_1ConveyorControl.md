**Explanation:**

* **Initial Step:** The program starts here.
* **S1: Object Detected:** This step checks if any of the five sensors detect an object. 
* **S2: No Object / Start Conveyor:** If no object is detected, the conveyor starts running at 2 m/s.
* **S3: Stop Requested:** This step checks if any of the three stop buttons at the stations are pressed.
* **S4: Running:** The conveyor continues running while objects are detected and no stop is requested.
* **S5: Stopped:** The conveyor stops if a stop is requested or no object is detected.
* **S6: Check Sensors:** This step checks if any sensor detects an object while the conveyor is stopped. 
* **S7: Wait for Start:** The system waits for an object to be detected before restarting.
* **S8, S9, S10: Station Stops:** These steps represent the individual stop buttons at each station.  
* **S11: Restart:** If a stop was requested and then cleared, the conveyor restarts. 

**Compliance with IEC 61131-3:**

* The SFC program uses standardized symbols for steps, transitions, and actions. 
* The program flow is clear and follows the defined sequence.
* The transitions are defined with logical conditions based on sensor inputs and stop requests.
* Actions like starting and stopping the conveyor are clearly defined within the respective steps. 

**Additional Considerations:**

* The specific sensor and actuator addresses need to be added to the actions within the steps.
* Timers or counters might be needed depending on the desired behavior for object detection and stop requests. 
* Error handling routines can be incorporated for fault conditions.
