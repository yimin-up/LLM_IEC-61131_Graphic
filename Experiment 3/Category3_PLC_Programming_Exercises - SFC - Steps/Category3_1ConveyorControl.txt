Given the requirements, let's break down the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) design for controlling a conveyor belt system with three stations that allow user interaction for stopping the conveyor, and sensors for object detection aligned with maintaining a conveyor speed of 2 meters per second.

### Step 1:####
Inputs:
- Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5: The presence sensors along the conveyor belt that detect objects.
- StopStation1, StopStation2, StopStation3: User input to stop the conveyor at each station.

Outputs:
- ConveyorMotor: Controls the conveyor belt's motor.
- ConveyorSpeedControl: A variable/actuator to control the speed of the conveyor belt, set to 2 meters per second.

### Step 3:####
Explanation of Steps, Actions, and Transitions:
- **Start**: The initial state where the system checks if any of the sensors detect objects.
- **Check**: A decision step to evaluate which sensors are active and determine the next action. For example, launching the conveyor belt if any sensors are triggered.
- **Move**: Represents the conveyor belt in operation. This step activates the `ConveyorMotor` and sets `ConveyorSpeedControl` to 2 meters/sec.
- **Stop**: Final step where the conveyor belt stops due to lack of objects detected or a stop request at any station.
- **Transitions**: 
  - Between each "Move" step and its platforms (SS1, SS2, SS3), transitions check for user stop requests.
  - Between sensor checks transitions ensure that movement continues while there's an object detected and stops if none.

####

### Step 4:####
The state machine constructed by this SFC includes four major states (Start, Check, Move, Stop) representing the operational phases of the conveyor belt. In the "Move" state, there are intermediate conditions to handle user stop requests at any of the three stations, effectively pausing the conveyor belt operation and resuming it based on sensor detection. This setup provides a dynamic response to both object detection and user interaction.

####

### Step 5:####
Upon reviewing the SFC design against the IEC 61131-3 standard:
- The design specifies inputs, outputs, and the sequential logic clearly.
- It incorporates decision-making based on sensor inputs and user requests, as expected in an SFC.
- The "Move" actions along with transition conditions between steps comply with the standard's requirements for programmable logic controller programming.
- The speed control of the conveyor is maintained as per requirement, fulfilling the continuous operation condition.
- This SFC allows for flexibility in operation while maintaining a specific control flow, which meets the standard's procedural control requirements.

Therefore, the design adheres to the IEC 61131-3 standard principles for SFC programs, focusing on control flow and logical operation based on variable states and inputs.
