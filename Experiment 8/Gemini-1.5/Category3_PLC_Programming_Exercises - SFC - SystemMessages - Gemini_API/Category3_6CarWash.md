## Automatic Car Wash Station SFC Program

Here is an IEC 61131-3 compliant SFC program for an automatic car wash station with a single station, using ASCII art representation:

```
    +-------+    +-------+
    | INIT |    | IDLE |---+
    +-------+    +-------+   |
       |           |          |
       | Car at    | No car  |
       | station?  | at      | 
       V           | station |
    +-------+    +-------+   |
    | CHECK |    |       |   |
    | HUMAN |----+       |   |
    +-------+             |   |
       | No human?        |   |
       V                  |   |
    +-------+             |   |
    | WASH  |-------------+   |
    | CAR   |                 |
    +-------+                 |
       |        Human        |
       |        present?     | 
       V                     |
    +-------+                 |
    | ALARM |-----------------+
    +-------+
``` 

**Explanation of steps:**

1. **INIT:** This is the initial step, executed only once at the start of the program. It can be used for initialization tasks, like setting variables or flags.
2. **IDLE:** The system waits in this state until a car is detected at the station.
3. **CHECK HUMAN:** When a car is detected, the system checks if any human is present in the car wash area. 
4. **WASH CAR:** If no human is present, the car wash cycle starts. This step can involve activating various outputs to control water spray, soap dispensers, brushes, dryers, etc., based on the specific car wash process.
5. **ALARM:** If a human is detected while a car is at the station, the system enters the ALARM state. This may involve turning on an alarm light or sound, stopping the car wash process, and potentially resetting the system to a safe state. 

**Additional considerations:**

* **Timers:** You might need to incorporate timers into the SFC to control the duration of each step in the car wash process (e.g., soap application, rinsing, drying).
* **Sensors:** The type and placement of sensors will depend on your specific car wash setup. You might need sensors for car detection, human presence detection, water level, soap level, etc.
* **Outputs:** The outputs will control various equipment in the car wash station, such as pumps, motors, valves, and lights.
* **Safety:** Safety is paramount in an automated system like a car wash. Ensure appropriate safety measures are implemented, such as emergency stops and safeguards against equipment malfunction.

**Implementation in an IEC 61131-3 PLC Programming environment:**

* This SFC program can be implemented using the Sequential Function Chart editor in your chosen PLC programming software.
* Each step will be represented as a block with its associated actions and transitions.
* You will need to configure the input and output variables connected to the physical sensors and actuators of the car wash station.
* You can add timers and counters as needed to control the timing and sequence of operations.

**Remember, this is a basic example. The actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements and complexity of your car wash system.**
