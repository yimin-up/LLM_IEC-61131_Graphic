For a PID feedback flow control system in a water treatment process, where we aim to maintain chlorine dosing at a rate of 3 ppm with a sampling rate of 100 milliseconds, the ladder logic program must include key components like PID control function block, input for the process variable (current chlorine ppm in water), setpoint input (desired chlorine ppm), and an output to adjust the chlorine dosing rate. Since IEC 61131-3 doesn't directly specify ASCII representations for all specific function blocks like PID, we'll create a generic representation based on common elements.

### Description:

1. **PV (Process Variable)**: This is where the current chlorine concentration (ppm) is input into the system. It's compared against the setpoint.
2. **Setpoint**: This represents the desired chlorine concentration, set to 3 ppm in this scenario.
3. **PID Block**: The core of the control system where PID calculations are made based on the difference between the Setpoint and PV. The PID block would need to be configured with appropriate `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` values for proportional, integral, and derivative gains to maintain the chlorine dosage at the desired level.
4. **Reset**: Allows for manual resetting of the PID calculations, useful for maintaining control and stability, especially when the process dynamics change significantly.
5. **Sampling Rate**: While not directly depicted in the ladder logic, the system assumes a control loop that repeats every 100 ms to read the current chlorine concentration and adjust the dosing rate accordingly.
6. **Output to adjust**: The output from the PID controller goes to control the dosing pump, adjusting the flow rate to keep the chlorine dosage at the target level.

This diagram illustrates a simplified approach to designing a PID-based control system for a chemical dosing process in a water treatment application according to the requirements and constraints provided. In practice, the PID block configuration would require tuning the `Kp`, `Ki`, and `Kd` parameters specifically for the process dynamics to achieve the desired control performance.
