Key points:
1. The SFC has an initial step.
2. There are two main branches for Manual and Auto modes, selected based on respective button presses. 
3. In Manual mode, the sequence is Clip -> Transfer -> Release, each triggered by respective button presses.
4. In Auto mode, the sequence Clip -> Transfer (2s delay) -> Release is automatically executed once the Auto button is pressed. It can repeat if Auto is pressed again.
5. The Manual and Auto sequences are interlocked, meaning only one can execute at a time.

This SFC captures the key requirements you described for the pick-and-place robot application. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
