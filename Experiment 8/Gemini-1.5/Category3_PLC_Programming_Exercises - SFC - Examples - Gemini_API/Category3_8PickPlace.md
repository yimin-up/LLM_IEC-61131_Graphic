**Explanation:**

* **Initial Step:** This is the starting point of the SFC program. 
* **Auto and Manual Transitions:** The program branches based on whether the "Auto" or "Manual" button is pressed. 
* **Auto_Start Step:** Activates the "Clip" command to grip the product from conveyor A.
* **Transfer_Delay Step:** Introduces a 2-second delay before moving the product.
* **Transfer Step:** Activates the "Transfer" command to move the product to conveyor B.
* **Release Step:** Activates the "Release" command to release the product onto conveyor B.
* **Manual_Mode Step:** This step remains active as long as the "Manual" button is pressed. 
* **Manual Actions:** While in Manual_Mode, the "Clip," "Transfer," and "Release" commands can be activated independently by pressing the corresponding buttons (indicated by the "P" action).

**Interlocking:**

* The transition conditions for "Auto" and "Manual" ensure that only one mode is active at a time. 
* The "Manual_Mode" step has no outgoing transitions, preventing any automatic actions while in manual mode.

**Additional Considerations:**

* You may need additional steps or actions depending on the specific robot and conveyor system. 
* Error handling and safety routines should be implemented as needed.
* The program assumes the robot and conveyors are properly initialized and ready for operation.
