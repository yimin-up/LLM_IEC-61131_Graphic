Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program to control the pneumatic system per the requirements:

Inputs:
I1.0 - Cycle timer, 100ms
I1.1 - Pressure sensor, low limit 5.5 bar 
I1.2 - Pressure sensor, high limit 6 bar

Outputs:  
Q2.0 - Solenoid valve, air flow control to 50 slpm
Q2.1 - Compressor control

Description:
- The TON timer block runs the control loop at 100ms frequency
- If pressure is below 5.5 bar, Q2.0 and Q2.1 energize to allow air flow and run compressor
- If pressure is above 6 bar, Q2.0 and Q2.1 de-energize to stop air flow and compressor
- When pressure is between 5.5 and 6 bar, Q2.0 energizes to allow 50 slpm air flow, Q2.1 stays off

This LD controls the pneumatic system to maintain 5.5-6 bar pressure and 50 slpm flow rate to the actuators, running the control logic every 100ms. Let me know if you have any other questions!
