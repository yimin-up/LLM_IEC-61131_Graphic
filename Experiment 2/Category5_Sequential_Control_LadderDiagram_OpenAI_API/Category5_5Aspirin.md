> Create an ISA-88 control recipe of a batch production for aspirin known as acetylsalicylic acid. The physical structure consists of a reactor, a crystallizer, a centrifuge and a dryer. Educts are Acetic anhydride, Salicylic acid, and sulphuric acid as catalyst. Products are acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid. Drying should happen at 90 째C.

Given the design requirements, we need to focus on the reaction stage of the aspirin production. In this particular stage, the main activities include the addition of Acetic anhydride, Salicylic acid, and Sulphuric acid into the reactor, heating and maintaining the reaction mixture at a specific temperature for a given time to facilitate the reaction. For simplicity, let's assume the process parameters as follows (these values are for illustrative purposes and might not reflect real industrial conditions):

1. Temperature for reaction: 70째C (to be maintained for 60 minutes).
2. Order of addition: Salicylic acid -> Sulphuric acid -> Acetic anhydride.

We will also assume that we have the following inputs and outputs in our PLC program:

Inputs:
- T_Reactor (Temperature of the reactor, analog input)
- Start_Process (Boolean input to start the reaction process)

Outputs:
- Valve_SA (Valve for Salicylic acid, boolean)
- Valve_SuA (Valve for Sulphuric acid, boolean)
- Valve_AA (Valve for Acetic anhydride, boolean)
- Heater (Heats the reactor, boolean)
- Process_Done (Indicates the completion of the reaction stage, boolean)

Given these specifications, the following is a simplified Ladder Diagram program in ASCII art representation, embodying a sequence of operations for the reaction stage. Note that real-world applications may require more complex logic including safety checks, PID control for temperature regulation, and further steps for the process.

This ladder diagram outlines the controlled sequence of adding reactants, heating the reactor to the reaction temperature, and maintaining that temperature for the necessary duration. It simplifies the real-world complexities of such a process, neglecting elements like interlocks for safety, precise control of flow rates, or detailed error handling which are crucial in a real industrial setting.
