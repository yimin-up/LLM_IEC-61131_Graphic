For a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) feedback control system in a distillation column context, the key elements include a level sensor for the column (as input), and a control signal to an inlet valve (as output). In a simplified manner within IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram (LD) constraints, implementing PID control directly in LD might not encapsulate all nuances of PID algorithms (which are more naturally implemented in Function Block Diagram or Structured Text). However, I can design a simplified version focusing on the principle of monitoring and adjusting the level via an inlet valve.

Step 1:####
Inputs:
- LS (Level Sensor) - Represents the current level in the distillation column. Symbol: I0.0 (assuming first digital input).

Outputs:
- IV (Inlet Valve Control) - Controls the opening of the inlet valve to allow more or less feed into the column based on the control logic. Symbol: Q0.0 (assuming first digital output).

####

Step 2:####
This is a simplified illustration and does not depict a PID control accurately due to the nature of ladder diagrams, but it gives a basic representation of controlling a valve based on the level sensor input.

```
(Start)！[ I0.0 ]！(PID Control Logic)！！(Q0.0 - IV)
        [       ]！(More Logic as Needed)！！()
```

####

Step 3:####
In this simplified representation (since actual PID computations are beyond simple ladder logic without embedding function blocks of code):
- When the level sensor (LS) detects a value that implies the need for adjustment (we will assume that any detection triggers the logic for simplicity), the PID Control Logic (a placeholder for actual PID computations likely embedded in a more sophisticated form or handled by a dedicated PID controller or software function block) operates to adjust the inlet valve IV accordingly.

####

Step 4:####
State Machine Description:
1. **Initialization**: System starts, level sensor (LS) and inlet valve control (IV) are initialized.
2. **Monitoring**: The system continuously reads the LS input to detect the current level in the distillation column.
3. **Decision and Control Execution**: Based on the LS input, the "PID Control Logic" determines whether to open or close the IV more or less, adjusting the feed to the distillation column to maintain the desired level.
4. **Iteration**: The system loops back to the Monitoring step, continuously adjusting the inlet valve based on the level sensor feedback.

####

Step 5:####
Checking the Ladder Diagram (LD) according to IEC 61131 Standard:
- **Inputs and Outputs Identification**: Clearly identified and used standard symbols as per IEC 61131-3, where inputs and outputs begin with 'I' and 'Q', respectively.
- **Structured Approach**: The LD programmatically captures the logic for a simple feedback control mechanism, suitable for straightforward applications. However, it's essential to note PID algorithms involve mathematical computations, which in real-world applications, require integration with software function blocks or dedicated PID controllers that can be interfaced or configured via the LD environment.
- **Compliance**: While the LD follows basic principles of logic control, for actual PID functionality, integration with additional software or function blocks that perform real PID computations would be necessary to meet application requirements effectively.
- **Safety and Robustness**: Any control system, especially for processes like distillation columns, must include considerations for safe operation, including failsafes for sensor failure, valve malfunction, and overflow/underflow conditions. These would typically be implemented as additional rungs or integrated into the control logic and are crucial for IEC 61131-3 compliance in industrial applications.

This overview provides a conceptual understanding within the constraints of a relatively simple query format and acknowledges the limitations of purely LD-based representations for complex control algorithms like PID.
