Creating a Structured Text (ST) program for a PLC that fulfills the provided pick-and-place requirements involves writing a control algorithm that handles manual and automatic modes by utilizing input buttons and controlling outputs such as a robotic arm. Below, I'll provide a sample ST code snippet in accordance with IEC 61131-3 that represents the described functionality:

```iec
PROGRAM PickAndPlace
    // Inputs
    VAR_INPUT
        Manual : BOOL; // Button for Manual Mode
        Auto : BOOL; // Button for Auto Mode
        Clip : BOOL; // Button to clip from conveyor A in Manual Mode
        Transfer : BOOL; // Button to move to conveyor B in Manual Mode
        Release : BOOL; // Button to release on conveyor B in Manual Mode
    END_VAR
    
    // Outputs
    VAR_OUTPUT
        ActuateClip : BOOL; // Command to clip the product
        ActuateTransfer : BOOL; // Command to transfer the product
        ActuateRelease: BOOL; // Command to release the product
        IsAutoActive: BOOL; // To indicate if Auto mode is currently running
    END_VAR
    
    // Internal variables
    VAR
        IsManualActive : BOOL := FALSE; // To indicate if Manual mode is currently running
        AutoTimer : TON; // Timer for simulating the 2-second transfer in Auto Mode
    END_VAR
    
    // Control logic
    IF Auto AND NOT IsManualActive THEN // Auto Mode
        ActuateClip := TRUE;
        ActuateTransfer := FALSE;
        ActuateRelease := FALSE;
        // Start the transfer process
        AutoTimer(IN:=TRUE, PT:=T#2s); // Delay transfer for 2 seconds
        IF AutoTimer.Q THEN
            ActuateClip := FALSE; // Assume robotic arm holds the product without a persisting signal
            ActuateTransfer := TRUE;
            ActuateRelease := TRUE;
            IsAutoActive := TRUE;
            AutoTimer(IN:=FALSE); // Reset the timer for the next usage
        END_IF;
    ELSIF Manual THEN // Manual Mode
        IsAutoActive := FALSE;
        IsManualActive := TRUE;
        // Manual control commands directly map to output
        ActuateClip := Clip;
        ActuateTransfer := Transfer;
        ActuateRelease := Release;
    ELSE
        // Reset everything if neither Auto nor Manual is active
        ActuateClip := FALSE;
        ActuateTransfer := FALSE;
        ActuateRelease := FALSE;
        IsAutoActive := FALSE;
        IsManualActive := FALSE;
        AutoTimer(IN:=FALSE); // Ensure the timer is reset
    END_IF;
    
    // Interlocking mechanism between Manual and Auto modes to prevent overlaps
    IF IsAutoActive THEN
        IsManualActive := FALSE; // Prevent Manual mode entry during Auto operation
    END_IF;
    
    // Don't process new Auto cycle until the previous one is completed
    IF Auto AND IsAutoActive THEN
        Auto := FALSE;
    END_IF;

    // Updating timer for auto mode
    AutoTimer(); // Always call the TON instance in each scan cycle

END_PROGRAM
```

This program assumes that the variables `Manual`, `Auto`, `Clip`, `Transfer`, and `Release` are physical inputs linked to buttons and that `ActuateClip`, `ActuateTransfer`, and `ActuateRelease` are outputs controlling actuators. The single-action auto mode is controlled by a timer (`AutoTimer`) which is set for 2 seconds as needed. The manual mode is simple direct control. The program code ensures that the manual and automatic modes are interlocked, meaning they cannot be active at the same time.

Note: This is a basic representation of the expected behavior. In a real-world application, additional features, such as error handling, safety checks, and synchronization with conveyor sensors might be required. Typically, the actuators and sensors would feed back to the PLC, ensuring actions are complete before proceeding to the next steps, but those are not covered in the above simple description and code representation.
