Creating a self-contained Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for PID feedback flow control, especially to maintain a specific chemical dosing rate in a water treatment process, requires several considerations. Given the specifications for maintaining a chlorine dosing rate of 3 parts per million (ppm) and a system that samples every 100 milliseconds (ms), we'll design a basic structure. In real-world applications, integrating with the IEC 61131-3 environment and using its programming languages, such as Structured Text (ST) for the PID control logic, is necessary.

However, the SFC will focus on the higher-level process flow. Since detailed PID algorithm implementation varies and typically relies on additional programming constructs, consider this SFC as a framework for the process states and transitions. You'll need to link it with the PID controller logic implemented in another section of your PLC program.

### Key States Explained:
- **Start**: Initialization of the control system.
- **S1 - Check Flow Rate**: The system checks if the flow rate is within the target range based on the 3 ppm dosing rate.
- **S2 - Calculate PID Adjustments**: If the flow rate is not achieved, the system calculates the necessary adjustments using the PID control logic.
- **S3 - Adjust Chlorine Dosing Rate**: The system adjusts the chlorine dosing rate based on PID calculations.
- **S4 - Monitor & Maintain**: Continuously monitor the flow rate and maintain the dosing rate at 3 ppm.

### Transitions:
- **Initial Activation**: Trigger to start the chemical dosing process.
- **YES/NO (After S1)**: Determines if the current dosing rate is within acceptable limits.
- **PID Adjustment Calculated**: Indicates completion of the PID adjustment calculation.
- **Dosing Rate Adjusted**: Indicates the chlorine dosing rate has been adjusted as needed.
- **Cycle Complete? NO**: Indicates the process continues to monitor and adjust as necessary.

This SFC structure provides a conceptual framework. The PID control logic itself would need to be elaborated using IEC 61131-3 compliant languages like Structured Text or Ladder Logic, ensuring accurate real-time adjustments to maintain the desired chemical dosing rate.
