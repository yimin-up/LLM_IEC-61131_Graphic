Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 sequential function chart program to control a heating system to maintain temperature between 20°„C and 22°„C based on three temperature sensors:

```
PROGRAM HeatingControl
VAR
  Temp1, Temp2, Temp3: REAL;  // Temperature sensor inputs 
  HeaterOutput: BOOL;         // Heater control output
  AverageTemp: REAL;          // Calculated average temperature
END_VAR

(* Main control steps *)
INITIAL_STEP Init:
  HeaterOutput := FALSE;
  -> Monitoring;

STEP Monitoring:
  AverageTemp := (Temp1 + Temp2 + Temp3) / 3.0;
  
  IF AverageTemp < 20.0 THEN
    -> HeatingOn;
  ELSIF AverageTemp > 22.0 THEN  
    -> HeatingOff;
  END_IF;

STEP HeatingOn:
  HeaterOutput := TRUE;
  
  IF AverageTemp > 21.0 THEN
    -> Monitoring;
  END_IF;
  
STEP HeatingOff:
  HeaterOutput := FALSE;

  IF AverageTemp < 21.0 THEN
    -> Monitoring; 
  END_IF;

END_PROGRAM
```

The key aspects:

1. Temperature sensor inputs Temp1, Temp2, Temp3 are declared as REALs
2. HeaterOutput is a BOOL to turn heater on/off 
3. AverageTemp stores calculated average of 3 sensors
4. Init step ensures heater starts off, transitions to Monitoring 
5. Monitoring calculates average temp, transitions to HeatingOn if < 20°„C or HeatingOff if > 22°„C
6. HeatingOn turns output on, transitions back to Monitoring when temp > 21°„C
7. HeatingOff turns output off, transitions to Monitoring when temp < 21°„C

This maintains the temperature between 20-22°„C. The 1 degree hysteresis between heating on/off prevents rapid cycling.
