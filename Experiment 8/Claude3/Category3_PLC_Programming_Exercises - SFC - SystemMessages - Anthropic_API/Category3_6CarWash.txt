Here's an SFC program for an automatic car wash station based on your requirements:

       +-----------+
       |   START   |
       +-----------+
             |
             |
             v
    +-------------------+
    |   Car Detected?   |
    +-------------------+
      |YES         |NO
      |            |
      v            |
+-------------+    |
|  Human       |   |
|  Detected?   |   |
+-------------+    |
  |YES    |NO      |
  |       |        |
  |       v        |
  |   +-------------+
  |   |    Wash     |
  |   |     Car     |
  |   +-------------+
  |        |
  |        v
  |   +-------------+
  |   |  Washing    |
  |   | Completed?  |
  |   +-------------+
  |     |YES   |NO
  |     |      |
  |     |      |
  v     |      |
+-------------+ |
|    Alarm     | |
+-------------+ |
                |
                |
                v
           +-----------+
           |   STOP    |
           +-----------+

Actions:
- Wash Car: Activate car wash sequence (soap, rinse, dry)
- Alarm: Activate alarm to alert operator about human presence

Transitions:
- Car Detected?: Sensor input to detect car presence
- Human Detected?: Sensor input to detect human presence in the wash area
- Washing Completed?: Timer or sensor input to determine if washing is finished

Note: This is a simplified SFC and additional steps, actions, and transitions may be needed for a complete implementation. Safety measures, manual override, and error handling should also be considered in a real-world application.
