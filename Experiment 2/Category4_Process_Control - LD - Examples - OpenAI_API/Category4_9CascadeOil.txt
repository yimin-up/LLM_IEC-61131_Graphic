Implementing a cascade control system for pressure in an oil refinery vessel through a Ladder Diagram in IEC 61131-3 may involve several devices and sensors. Here's how such a system could be diagrammed using ASCII art, assuming the primary loop is to maintain pressure (PressureSP for setpoint and PressurePV for process variable) and the secondary loop regulates flow (FlowSP for setpoint and FlowPV for process variable), with actuator ControlValve to adjust the flow based on the system needs:

- **Primary Control Loop**: This controls the pressure in the vessel. The PID block takes the pressure setpoint (PressureSP) and the actual pressure (PressurePV), computes the difference, and adjusts the manipulated variable (PressureMV) accordingly. This MV can adjust a manual valve or act as a setpoint for the secondary loop.
  
- **Secondary Control Loop**: Its role is to control the flow into the vessel based on the output from the primary control loop. In this context, the PressureMV acts as the setpoint for flow (FlowSP), which is then used by another PID block to adjust the ControlValve to achieve desired flow rates into the vessel to maintain the pressure setpoint.

- **Process**: The actual pressure and flow readings would be provided by sensors located in the vessel and in the flow line, respectively.

- **MV (Manipulated Variable)**: Adjustments in this control setup are typically made through control valves. In the primary loop, the MV can be used directly or indirectly (as in it sets the SP for the secondary loop).

- **Interaction**: The outcome of the primary loop directly influences the setpoint of the secondary loop, illustrating the cascade nature of this control system.

This diagram is quite simplified and conceptual. In a real-world implementation, additional considerations such as safety interlocks, fail-safe positions for valves, manual override capabilities, and alarms for out-of-spec conditions would be necessary.
