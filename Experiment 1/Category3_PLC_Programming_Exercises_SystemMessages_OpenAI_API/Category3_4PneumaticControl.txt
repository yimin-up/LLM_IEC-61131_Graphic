Given the task, I'll create a structured text program in accordance with the IEC 61131-3 standard. This program will control a pneumatic system, ensuring it meets the specified flow and pressure requirements. Remember, in an actual system, you would need to tailor the program according to specific sensor inputs and actuator interfaces, which can vary greatly. The following example assumes that the system provides the current flow in standard liters per minute (SLPM) and pressure in bars through analog inputs, and controls the flow by adjusting a valve through an analog output.

For simplicity, the program loops every 100 ms, reading current flow and pressure, then adjusting the valve position to maintain flow at 50 SLPM while keeping pressure within 5.5 to 6 bars. If the pressure is out of range, the primary objective becomes pressure correction over maintaining flow.

```pascal
PROGRAM PneumaticSystemControl
VAR
    flowSetpoint: REAL := 50.0; (* Desired flow in SLPM *)
    pressureLowLimit: REAL := 5.5; (* Pressure lower limit in bars *)
    pressureHighLimit: REAL := 6.0; (* Pressure upper limit in bars *)
    currentFlow: REAL; (* Current flow in SLPM read from an analog input *)
    currentPressure: REAL; (* Current pressure in bars read from an analog input *)
    valvePosition: REAL; (* Valve position as a percentage, sent to an analog output *)
    controlFrequency: TIME := T#100ms; (* Control loop frequency *)
END_VAR

(* Placeholder function to simulate reading from an analog input. 
   In a real program, this would interface with your PLC's I/O system. *)
FUNCTION ReadAnalogInput : REAL
VAR_INPUT
    channel : INT; (* Analog channel number *)
END_VAR
    ReadAnalogInput := 0; (* Return a simulated value. This should be replaced by actual read code. *)
END_FUNCTION

(* Placeholder function to simulate writing to an analog output.
   In the actual scenario, this would control the valve via your PLC's I/O system. *)
FUNCTION WriteAnalogOutput : BOOL
VAR_INPUT
    channel : INT; (* Analog output channel number *)
    value : REAL; (* Value to write, typically representing valve position or similar. *)
END_VAR
    WriteAnalogOutput := TRUE; (* Simulate successful write. Replace with actual write code. *)
END_FUNCTION

(* Control loop *)
WHILE(1) DO
    currentFlow := ReadAnalogInput(1);  (* Assume channel 1 is flow *)
    currentPressure := ReadAnalogInput(2);  (* Assume channel 2 is pressure *)

    IF (currentPressure < pressureLowLimit) OR (currentPressure > pressureHighLimit) THEN
        (* Priority 1: Adjust valve to correct pressure, disregarding flow *)
        IF currentPressure < pressureLowLimit THEN
            valvePosition := valvePosition + 1.0; (* Simplified control: open valve more if pressure is too low *)
        ELSIF currentPressure > pressureHighLimit THEN
            valvePosition := valvePosition - 1.0; (* Simplified control: close valve more if pressure is too high *)
        END_IF;
    ELSIF (currentFlow <> flowSetpoint) THEN
        (* Priority 2: Adjust valve to reach flow setpoint *)
        IF currentFlow < flowSetpoint THEN
            valvePosition := valvePosition + 0.5; (* Open valve slightly to increase flow *)
        ELSE
            valvePosition := valvePosition - 0.5; (* Close valve slightly to decrease flow *)
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
    
    (* Ensure valve position stays within 0-100% limit *)
    IF valvePosition < 0 THEN
        valvePosition := 0;
    ELSIF valvePosition > 100 THEN
        valvePosition := 100;
    END_IF;

    WriteAnalogOutput(1, valvePosition); (* Assume valve control is on channel 1 *)

    (* Wait for the next control cycle *)
    SLEEP(controlFrequency);
END_WHILE
END_PROGRAM
```

Notes:
- Actual sensor and actuator interfacing code would replace the `ReadAnalogInput` and `WriteAnalogOutput` functions. 
- Error handling, more sophisticated control strategies (e.g., PID control), and safety checks should be included in real applications but are simplified here due to space constraints.
- This example uses a simple corrective strategy for valve positioning; in a practical scenario, a PID controller might be more appropriate for maintaining specific setpoints and system dynamics efficiently.
- The `SLEEP` function is a placeholder for the PLC's timing control mechanism. Depending on the PLC, you might need a specific function to achieve precise timing.
