Given the requirements for the pick-and-place robot application, we need to implement a control system using Structured Text (ST) programming language according to IEC 61131-3 standards. The program should handle two operational modes: Auto and Manual, with specific behaviors as described. In addition, we'll implement interlocking between manual and auto modes to ensure they are not active simultaneously.

First, we need to declare the necessary variables: inputs for the Auto and Manual mode switches, inputs for the manual operation buttons (Clip, Transfer, Release), and timers to handle the auto operation delays.

```pascal
PROGRAM PickAndPlaceControl
VAR
    // Input buttons
    AutoModeButton, ManualModeButton : BOOL;
    ClipButton, TransferButton, ReleaseButton : BOOL;

    // States
    InAutoMode, InManualMode : BOOL;
    AutoClip, AutoTransfer, AutoRelease : BOOL;
    TransferTimer : TON;

    // Outputs to control the robotic arm
    Clip, Transfer, Release : BOOL;
END_VAR
```

Next, we implement the logic for switching between Manual and Auto modes, manual operation control, and the auto operation sequence.

```pascal
// Mode selection logic
InAutoMode := NOT InManualMode AND AutoModeButton;
InManualMode := NOT InAutoMode AND ManualModeButton;

// Reset auto process flags when entering manual mode or completing auto cycle
IF NOT InAutoMode THEN
    AutoClip := FALSE;
    AutoTransfer := FALSE;
    AutoRelease := FALSE;
END_IF;

// Manual mode control
IF InManualMode THEN
    IF ClipButton THEN
        Clip := TRUE;
    ELSEIF TransferButton THEN
        Clip := FALSE; // Assuming Clip must be disengaged before transferring.
        Transfer := TRUE;
    ELSEIF ReleaseButton THEN
        Transfer := FALSE; // Assuming Transfer must disengage before releasing.
        Release := TRUE;
    ELSE
        Clip := FALSE;
        Transfer := FALSE;
        Release := FALSE;
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Auto mode control
IF InAutoMode THEN
    IF NOT AutoClip THEN // Initiate clip action
        Clip := TRUE;
        AutoClip := TRUE;
        AutoTransfer := FALSE;
        AutoRelease := FALSE;
    ELSIF AutoClip AND NOT AutoTransfer THEN // Initiate transfer after clip
        TransferTimer(IN := TRUE, PT := T#2S);
        IF TransferTimer.Q THEN
            Clip := FALSE; // Assuming Clip must be disengaged before transferring.
            Transfer := TRUE;
            AutoTransfer := TRUE;
        END_IF;
    ELSIF AutoTransfer AND NOT AutoRelease THEN // Initiate release after transfer
        Clip := FALSE; // Ensure Clip is disengaged
        Transfer := FALSE; // Assume transfer action completes with the timer
        Release := TRUE;
        AutoRelease := TRUE;
    ELSE
        // Reset everything if the cycle is complete
        Clip := FALSE;
        Transfer := FALSE;
        Release := FALSE;
        InAutoMode := FALSE; // Optionally keep or remove to allow re-triggering Auto mode without pressing the button again.
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Handle releasing logic to reset Release signal
IF Release THEN
    Release := FALSE;
END_IF;
```

This program meets the requirements by allowing operation in either manual or auto mode, ensuring they are interlocked so both modes cannot be active simultaneously. In manual mode, the operator controls each step of the pick-and-place process with individual buttons. In auto mode, the process is sequenced with timing for the transfer operation. Note that the Boolean logic for button presses assumes momentary button actions. You might need to adjust based on your specific physical inputs.

This program is a basic structure and might require adjustments based on the detailed behavior of the robot's movements and the physical setup, including debouncing inputs or additional safety interlocks.
