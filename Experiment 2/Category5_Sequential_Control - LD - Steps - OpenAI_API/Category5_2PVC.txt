Given the task to create an ISA-88 control recipe for batch production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) by polymerizing vinyl chloride monomers with the process stages of polymerize, decover, and dry, let's develop a ladder diagram (LD) program accordingly.

#### Step 1:
The inputs and outputs for the Ladder Diagram (LD) based on the provided operations are as follows:

**Inputs:**
- Start_process (Boolean): Initiate the batch process.
- Temp_reached (Boolean): True if temperature is between 55 - 60°„C.
- Pressure_decreased (Boolean): True if reactor pressure decreases.

**Outputs:**
- Evacuate_reactor (Boolean): Activate reactor evacuation.
- Add_water_surfactants (Boolean): Activates valves/pumps for adding demineralized water and surfactants.
- Add_vinyl_chloride (Boolean): Actuates valve/pump for adding vinyl chloride monomer.
- Add_catalyst (Boolean): Actuates valve/pump for adding catalyst.
- Heat_reactor (Boolean): Activate reactor heating mechanism.
- Process_done (Boolean): Indicates completion of the batch process.

**Standard Symbols Used:**
- `(|)` - Normally open contact
- `( )` - Coil
- `[/]` - Normally closed contact
- `[/|\]` - Timer

#### Step 2:
```plaintext
(Start_process)-----(|)----[/|\]---(Evacuate_reactor)
                           T1: 5 min
                           Prepare reactor operation

                           -----(|)----(Add_water_surfactants)
                           After T1
                           Charge operation 1

                           -----(|)----[/|\]---(Add_vinyl_chloride)
                                  T2: 2 min
                                  After adding water & surfactants
                                  Charge operation 2

                           -----(|)----[/|\]---(Add_catalyst)
                                  T3: 1 min
                                  After T2
                                  React operation 1

                           -----(Temp_reached)-----(|)----(Heat_reactor)
                                               
                           -----(Pressure_decreased)-----(|)----[/|\]---(Process_done)
                                                             T4: Hold until pressure decrease
```

#### Step 3:
Logical expressions for each rung:

1. `Start_process AND NOT T1 Done` triggers `Evacuate_reactor`.
2. After T1 completes, trigger `Add_water_surfactants`.
3. `Add_water_surfactants AND NOT T2 Done` triggers `Add_vinyl_chloride`.
4. After T2 completes, `NOT T3 Done` triggers `Add_catalyst`.
5. If `Temp_reached` THEN `Heat_reactor`
6. If `Pressure_decreased AND NOT T4 Done`, then `Process_done` after T4.

#### Step 4:
The state machine is as follows:

1. **Initialization State:** Wait for `Start_process`.
2. **Prepare Reactor:** On start, evacuate the reactor for 5 minutes.
3. **Charge:** Sequentially add demineralized water and surfactants, then vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst, with respective timers.
4. **React:** Heat until the temperature reached is 55 - 60°„C and hold until the reactor pressure decreases indicating the end of the reaction.
5. **Completion:** Indicate process completion.

Each operation waits for the previous step to complete before proceeding, and certain steps are contingent on process conditions like temperature and pressure.

#### Step 5:
According to the IEC 61131 standard, the Ladder Diagram provided:

1. Follows the standard sequential organization of operations with clear start and end conditions.
2. Utilizes timers appropriately for controlling durations and sequential steps.
3. Uses conditions efficiently to move through the process stages.
4. Clearly delineates operations with start and end signals, aligning with control recipe requirements.
5. The logical expressions match with intended operations indicating the LD adheres to PLC programming practices as recommended by IEC 61131-3.

This LD program is structured to follow the sequential steps necessary for the batch production process of polyvinyl chloride, respecting the ISA-88 standards for control recipes and structured accordingly to IEC 61131-3 guidelines for ladder logic.
