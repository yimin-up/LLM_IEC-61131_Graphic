Implementing a feedforward control system for mixing two reactants using IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram (LD) programming involves directly controlling the addition of Reactant A and Reactant B based on a preset recipe or ratio. The objective is to maintain a desired mixture quality by accurately controlling the flow rates of both reactants. The automation of such a process might include feedforward elements where the control action is taken in anticipation of the final mixing outcome.

Note: The specific details like reactants feed rate, measurement units, and required mixing ratios are not provided. The program below assumes a simplified scenario where the control of reactant flow rates is based on digital signals (ON/OFF) for simplicity. In an actual industrial setting, such control would likely require more sophisticated analog control strategies, possibly involving PID controllers and flow meters.

In this simplified ladder diagram:
- `StartMixing` is a control bit that, when active, enables pumps for Reactant A and B.
- `PumpA` and `PumpB` are outputs to pumps controlling the flow of Reactants A and B, respectively.
- `ReactantALow` and `ReactantBLow` are inputs that indicate low levels of the reactants. If either is true, an `Alarm` is triggered.
- `DesiredRatioAB` and `ActualRatioAB` represent the desired and current ratio of Reactant A to B. In actual applications, this would require analog inputs and a more complex control strategy than depicted.
- `DesiredMixQuality` and `CurrentMixQuality` are placeholders for control elements aimed at ensuring the mix is within certain quality parameters. The `AdjustFlow` control might adjust valve positions to maintain the desired quality.
  
Please note, in real applications, controlling the mixing of chemical reactants precisely requires detailed process knowledge, including the specific properties of the reactants, desired end product specifications, and safety measures. This diagram is a basic representation meant to illustrate a concept rather than serve as a deployable control strategy.
