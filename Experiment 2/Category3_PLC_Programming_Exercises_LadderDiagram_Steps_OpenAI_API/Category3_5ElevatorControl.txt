To create a simplified Ladder Diagram (LD) program for an elevator control system according to IEC 61131-3 standards, we'll specify inputs, outputs, timers, and control logic. This solution assumes a basic model where the elevator responds to floor requests and incorporates safety and operational timing logic.

### Step 1:####
Inputs:
- Bottom limit switches for each floor (BLS1 to BLS5)
- Top limit switches for each floor (TLS1 to TLS5)
- Call buttons for each floor to go up (CBU1 to CBU4)
- Call buttons for each floor to go down (CBD2 to CBD5)
- Inside cabin buttons for each floor (F1 to F5)

Outputs:
- Motor direction UP (MUP)
- Motor direction DOWN (MDOWN)
- Elevator door control (DOOR)

Standard symbols:
- `/|` - Normally open contact
- `|\` - Normally closed contact
- `( )` - Coil

Timers:
- Door opening timer (T1) - 7 seconds
- Door re-open timer (T2) - 10 seconds

### Step 2:####
The Ladder Diagram program will be structured in ASCII art representing the simplified logic for elevator control.

```
Run 1:        +----[/| BLS1 |]----[/| BLS2 |]----[/| BLS3 |]----[/| BLS4 |]----[/| BLS5 |]----( MUP )
Run 2:        +----[/| TLS1 |]----[/| TLS2 |]----[/| TLS3 |]----[/| TLS4 |]----[/| TLS5 |]----( MDOWN )
Run 3:        +----[/| CBU1 |]----[/| CBD2 |]----[/| CBU2 |]----[/| CBD3 |]----[/| CBU3 |]----[/| CBD4 |]----[/| CBU4 |]----[/| CBD5 |]----[/| T1/|]----( DOOR )
Run 4:        +----[/| F1   |]----[/| F2   |]----[/| F3   |]----[/| F4   |]----[/| F5   |]----[/| T2/|]----( T1 )
```

### Step 3:####
Logical expressions for each rung:

- Run 1: If all the bottom limit switches are not triggered, the motor direction is set to UP.
- Run 2: If all the top limit switches are not triggered, the motor direction is set to DOWN.
- Run 3: The door opens if any call button is pressed or at the appointed floor (T1 is not timing).
- Run 4: If none of the inside cabin buttons are pressed within 10 seconds (T2 time elapsed), re-activate the door opening timer (T1).

### Step 4:####
The state machine of this Ladder Diagram:

1. The elevator motor direction control is determined by the limit switches on each floor ¡ª if the elevator is not at the top or bottom, it decides its direction based on the floor call buttons.
2. The door opening logic is managed by a 7-second timer, allowing passengers to exit or enter.
3. If no input is received from inside the cabin within 10 seconds, indicating all passengers have exited or no new floor request is made, the door will attempt to open again for another 7-second period to ensure any delayed passengers can board or exit.

This simplified model showcases fundamental aspects of elevator control, including motor direction, door operation, and basic safety features. It does not include all the intricacies of a full elevator control system, such as weight sensors, emergency operations, or detailed floor preference logic.
