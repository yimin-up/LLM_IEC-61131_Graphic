**Explanation:**

*   **Initial Step:** The program starts in the "Initial" step. 
*   **Start Step:** When Sensor1 detects an object, the program transitions to the "Start" step and activates the Conveyor_On output, starting the conveyor belt. It also sets the speed to 2 meters per second using the SetSpeed function.
*   **Station Steps:** The program then moves through "Station_1", "Station_2", and "Station_3" steps as objects are detected by Sensor2, Sensor3, and Sensor4 respectively. At each station, the program waits until the object leaves (NOT SensorX becomes true) before transitioning to the next step.
*   **Stop Buttons:** Each station has a StopButtonX input. If the button is pressed while the program is at that station, the Conveyor_Off output is activated, stopping the conveyor belt.
*   **Looping:** After the object passes Sensor4, the program loops back to the beginning and waits for a new object to be detected by Sensor1, starting the process again.

**Assumptions:**

*   SensorX inputs are true when an object is present and false otherwise.
*   StopButtonX inputs are true when the button is pressed and false otherwise.
*   Conveyor_On and Conveyor_Off outputs control the conveyor belt motor.
*   SetSpeed is a function that sets the conveyor belt speed. 
*   The conveyor belt is initially stopped. 

**Additional Notes:**

*   This program can be expanded to include additional stations and features as needed.
*   Safety considerations should be taken into account when designing and implementing the control system.
*   The specific implementation details of the SetSpeed function and the conveyor belt control outputs will depend on the specific hardware and software used.
