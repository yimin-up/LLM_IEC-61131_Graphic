Here's an IEC 61131-3 compliant Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for the pick-and-place robot application with two conveyors:

Step descriptions:
- INIT: Initialization step
- AUTO: Auto mode step, waiting for the Auto button to be pressed
- CLIP: Clipping the product from conveyor A
- TRANSFER: Transferring the product to conveyor B (2 seconds duration)
- RELEASE: Releasing the product onto conveyor B
- MANUAL: Manual mode step, waiting for manual control actions
- M_CLIP: Manual clipping of the product when Clip button is pressed
- M_TRANSFER: Manual transfer of the product when Transfer button is pressed
- M_RELEASE: Manual release of the product when Release button is pressed

Transitions:
- INIT to AUTO: Unconditional transition
- AUTO to CLIP: Auto button is pressed
- CLIP to TRANSFER: Clipping action completed
- TRANSFER to RELEASE: 2 seconds elapsed
- RELEASE to AUTO: Releasing action completed
- INIT to MANUAL: Unconditional transition
- MANUAL to M_CLIP: Clip button is pressed
- M_CLIP to M_TRANSFER: Transfer button is pressed
- M_TRANSFER to M_RELEASE: Release button is pressed
- M_RELEASE to MANUAL: Unconditional transition

The manual control process (MANUAL, M_CLIP, M_TRANSFER, M_RELEASE) and the auto control process (AUTO, CLIP, TRANSFER, RELEASE) are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at a time.
