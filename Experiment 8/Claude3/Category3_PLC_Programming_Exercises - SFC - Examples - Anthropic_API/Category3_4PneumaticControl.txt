Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 sequential function chart program to control the pneumatic system as specified:

```
PROGRAM PneumaticControl
VAR
  Pressure: REAL;  // Current system pressure in bar 
  FlowRate: REAL := 50.0;  // Target flow rate of 50 standard liters/min
  PressureHigh: BOOL;  // High pressure limit switch
  PressureLow: BOOL;   // Low pressure limit switch
  ValveOpen: BOOL;  // Output to open flow control valve
  ValveClose: BOOL; // Output to close flow control valve 
  CompressorOn: BOOL;  // Output to turn on air compressor
  CompressorOff: BOOL; // Output to turn off air compressor
END_VAR

(* Main control steps *)
INITIAL_STEP Init:
  CompressorOn := TRUE;
  ValveClose := TRUE;
END_STEP

TRANSITION FROM Init TO Pressurizing 
  := (Pressure < 5.5);

STEP Pressurizing:  
  CompressorOn := TRUE;
  ValveClose := TRUE;
END_STEP

TRANSITION FROM Pressurizing TO Regulating
  := (Pressure >= 5.5);
  
STEP Regulating:
  CompressorOff := TRUE;
  ValveOpen := (FlowRate < 50.0) & (Pressure > 5.5);
  ValveClose := (FlowRate >= 50.0) OR (Pressure <= 5.5); 
END_STEP

TRANSITION FROM Regulating TO Pressurizing
  := (Pressure < 5.5);

TRANSITION FROM Regulating TO Venting  
  := (Pressure > 6.0);

STEP Venting:
  CompressorOff := TRUE;
  ValveOpen := TRUE;
END_STEP
  
TRANSITION FROM Venting TO Regulating
  := (Pressure <= 6.0);
  
(* Pressure switch logic *)  
PressureHigh := (Pressure > 6.0);
PressureLow := (Pressure < 5.5);

(* Run control loop every 100 ms *)
CONFIG
  TASK ControlTask(INTERVAL := T#100ms);
END_CONFIG

PROGRAM_END
```

This SFC controls the pneumatic system in a loop running every 100 ms:

- It starts in an Init step that turns on the compressor and closes the valve
- It transitions to Pressurizing when pressure is below 5.5 bar
- In Pressurizing, it keeps the compressor on and valve closed to build pressure 
- It transitions to Regulating when pressure reaches 5.5 bar
- In Regulating, it turns off the compressor and modulates the valve to maintain 50 slpm flow
- If pressure drops below 5.5 bar it transitions back to Pressurizing
- If pressure exceeds 6 bar it transitions to Venting to relieve pressure
- It transitions back to Regulating when pressure drops to 6 bar

The high and low pressure limit switches are set based on the current pressure reading. Let me know if you have any other questions!
