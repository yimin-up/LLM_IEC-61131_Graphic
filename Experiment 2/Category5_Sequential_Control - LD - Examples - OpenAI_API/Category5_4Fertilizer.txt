Given the constraints and focusing on a simplified version of an ISA-88 compliant batch process for a urea fertilizer production's reaction stage, we can illustrate a common approach for the heating, cooling, and pressure regulation within a Ladder Diagram (LD). This example abstracts the complexity of a full ISA-88 recipe into manageable elements focused on control aspects.

Here's a high-level conceptualization as per IEC 61131-3 standards:

Explanation:

- **TempSetPoint/TempSensor:** Checks if the temperature is below the desired set point to activate the heating.
- **CoolingSetPoint/TempSensor:** Engages cooling if temperature exceeds a set threshold to prevent overheating.
- **PressureSetPoint/PressureSensor:** Manages the pressure within the reactor by adjusting a pressure valve, necessary for the urea synthesis reaction.
- **HeatingTimeMet, CoolingTimeMet, PressureTimeMet:** Utilizes timings to ensure proper reaction conditions are maintained for set durations, crucial for the completion of different reaction phase.
- **Timers (PT#XXm):** The timers are set to specific times, indicating the duration of each phase (e.g., PT#10m for heating might represent 10 minutes of required heating time). Adjust these timings based on the actual process requirements.

Note: This is a simplified and conceptual demonstration. Real-world industrial processes for urea production are significantly more complex, requiring detailed safety, control, and monitoring mechanisms beyond this scope. Always consult with a process engineer and safety expert when designing control systems for chemical processes.
