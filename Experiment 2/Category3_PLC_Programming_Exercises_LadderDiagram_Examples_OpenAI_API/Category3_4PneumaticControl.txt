Creating a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program that controls a pneumatic system while incorporating a control loop frequency and maintaining a specific flow and pressure involves simulating logical conditions for the system¡¯s operation. A basic representation can be done in ASCII art, though actual implementations would need specific function blocks for timing, pressure reading, and flow control, which are abstracted here for simplicity. 

This program aims to:
- Use a TON (Timer On Delay) function block to achieve a 100 ms control loop frequency.
- Evaluate pressure signals to maintain within 5.5 to 6 bar.
- Control a valve to adjust the air flow to 50 standard liters per minute (L/min).

Since Ladder Diagrams and textual descriptions of practical function blocks in IEC 61131-3 standard are not directly convertible into ASCII art, an abstract representation will be used.

Key Components:
- **TON Block**: Manages the control loop frequency at 100 ms intervals. ('EN' enable pin starts the timer, 'Q' enables output upon timer completion.)
- **Pressure Evaluation**: This section would logically contain conditions to compare the current pressure reading against the target pressure range (5.5 to 6 bar). If the pressure is outside this range, appropriate actions should be triggered to adjust the flow.
- **Valve Control**: Based on the evaluation of the pressure, this block controls the valve position to adjust the air flow into the system to maintain a steady flow rate of 50 standard liters per minute.

This diagram is a conceptual framework. Implementing it into a real PLC requires defining specific I/O addresses, configuring the timer with a precise time base, and integrating analog inputs for pressure sensing and flow control valves. Further details like handling overpressure conditions, safety shutdowns, and manual overrides would also have to be included for a complete solution.
