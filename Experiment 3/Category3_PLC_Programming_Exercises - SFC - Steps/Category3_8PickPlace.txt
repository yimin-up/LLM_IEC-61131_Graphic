Step 1:####
Inputs:
- Auto_Button: A Boolean input that triggers the auto control process.
- Manual_Button: A Boolean input for shifting to manual operation mode.
- Clip_Button: A Boolean input used in manual mode to clip the product from conveyor A.
- Transfer_Button: A Boolean input used in manual mode to initiate the transfer of the product to conveyor B.
- Release_Button: A Boolean input used in manual mode to release the product on conveyor B.

Outputs:
- Clip_Action: A Boolean output that activates the robot arm's clamping mechanism.
- Transfer_Action: A Boolean output that controls the motion of the robot arm between conveyors.
- Release_Action: A Boolean output that controls the release mechanism of the robot arm.

```
Step 3:####
- Start: Initializes the system.
- Check Mode: Decides the operation mode based on the state of the Auto_Button and the Manual_Button.
- Auto Mode: Not explicitly shown here, but involves automatic control of the process after selecting the auto mode.
- Manual Control: The entry state for manual operations, waits for input from the user.
- Clip Product: Activated when the Clip_Button is pressed, engages the Clip_Action to pick the product from conveyor A.
- Transfer Product: Enabled after Clip Product or upon pressing Transfer_Button, engages Transfer_Action to move the product.
- Release Product: This state is reached from Transfer Product, engaging Release_Action to release the product on conveyor B.

Step 4:####
The state machine described starts by initializing and then immediately checks the mode of operation (auto or manual). If manual mode is selected (via Manual_Button), the system waits for the user to press buttons in sequence: Clip, Transfer, and Release to move the product from conveyor A to conveyor B. Each action (Clip, Transfer, Release) corresponds to a state in the state machine. In auto mode (selected via Auto_Button), these steps would be automated with predefined timings, especially for the transfer action. Transitions between states are conditioned on the inputs, making the sequence adhere to the desired process flow.

Step 5:#### 
According to the IEC 61131-3 standard, this Sequential Function Chart (SFC) provides a clear, executable sequence of operations for a robotic pick-and-place system. The clear separation of steps and the use of conditions for transitions align with the IEC 61131-3 structures for SFC programming. The specified inputs and outputs also adhere to standard PLC practices, allowing for straightforward implementation in an IEC 61131-3 compliant PLC programming environment.
