To create a PID feedback pH control system using a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) according to the IEC 61131-3 standard, we should follow a systematic approach. Here¡¯s how we aim to address your requirement:

### Step 1:#### Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Sequential Function Chart.

Inputs:
- **pH_Sensor**: The analog input from the pH sensor, which measures the process variable (PV).
- **Set_Point**: The desired value (SP) of pH that the system should maintain.
- **Start_Control**: A boolean input to start the PID control process.

Outputs:
- **Valve_Control**: Output to control the valve used for adding acid or base to adjust the pH.

Intermediate Variables (if needed):
- **PID_Output**: The output of the PID calculation.

### Step 2:#### Briefly describe the state machine of the requirements.

The state machine for a PID feedback pH control will have the following states:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize system variables and prepare for control action.
2. **Measure**: Read the pH value from the sensor.
3. **Compute PID**: Compute the PID control logic based on the Set_Point and the measured pH.
4. **Adjust Valve**: Adjust the valve based on the PID_Output to correct the pH.
5. **Check**: Verify if the control needs to continue (e.g., if `Start_Control` is still true).

These stages help in systematically controlling the pH according to the desired set point using PID feedback mechanism.

### Step 3:#### Give the Sequential Function Chart program in ASCII art.

          V                                               |     |

    | Adjust Valve|<----------|      Check     |<---------+     |
    +------------+            +----------------+                |
          |                                                     |
          +-----------------------------------------------------+
```

### Step 4:#### Explain the purpose of each step, action, and transition.

- **Initialize**: Sets default values and prepares the system for operation. This is crucial for ensuring that the control starts in a known state.
- **Measure**: Reads and stores the current pH level from the pH sensor. This step is essential for obtaining the process variable (pH value) required for the PID calculation.
- **Compute PID**: Calculates the PID control signal based on the difference between the Set_Point (desired pH) and the measured pH. This signal determines how the valve should be adjusted to correct the pH level.
- **Adjust Valve**: Adjusts the valve control signal based on the PID_Output. This step directly influences the process by adding more acid or base to reach the desired pH level.
- **Check**: Determines whether the PID control loop should continue based on the `Start_Control` input. If the control should stop, it can loop back to initialization or maintain the current state without further adjustments.
- **Transitions**: The transitions manage the flow between different states based on conditions or the completion of tasks. They ensure that the process logically progresses from measuring, calculating, adjusting, and checking.

### Step 5:#### Check the SFC you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

The designed SFC follows the IEC 61131-3 standard, focusing primarily on structured text (ST) and Sequential Function Chart (SFC) programming segments. According to the standard, each step and transition should be clearly defined, and every step must perform a distinct action or task related to the overall control strategy.

Steps:
- Are clearly defined and encapsulate distinct parts of the PID control process.
- Contain actions (e.g., reading sensors, adjusting outputs) related directly to their names and purposes.
  
Transitions:
- Manage the logical flow based on state completion or input conditions, ensuring that the control loop can operate continuously or stop based on user commands.

This adherence maintains not only readability and organization but also ensures the program is maintainable and scalable, in line with the IEC 61131-3 principles for industrial control programming.
