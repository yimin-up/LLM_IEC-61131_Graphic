Designing an IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for a polyethylene production process involves various steps, each significant for the overall product quality and system efficiency. Below is a conceptual design outlined as per the requirements. Note that implementing this design into actual PLC programming would involve detailed function block development for each step, which is beyond the scope of ASCII art-based SFC plot, but I will describe how this process flows sequentially.

### Description of Each Step:

1. **Start_Process**: The initial step that triggers the start of the production batch.
2. **Raw Material Prep**: Preparation of raw materials required for polyethylene production.
3. **Polymerization**: The process where monomers combine to form a polymer, essentially creating polyethylene.
4. **Quenching**: Rapid cooling of polyethylene to halt the polymerization process at the desired stage.
5. **Drying**: Removal of any residual solvents or unwanted moisture from the product.
6. **Pelletizing**: Conversion of the dry polyethylene into pellets, a common form for storage and shipping.
7. **Quality Control**: Rigorous testing of the pellets to ensure they meet the required specifications.
8. **Packaging**: Packaging of the approved pellets for storage and distribution.
9. **Reprocess/Dispose**: Any product not passing QC is either reprocessed or disposed of appropriately.
10. **Storage**: Final pellets are stored adequately until they are shipped to the customer or further processed.

This SFC chart describes the sequential logic of operations in the polyethylene production process. Each step¡¯s transition condition to the next step would be program-defined based on sensor inputs and logical conditions fulfilling each process's completion criteria.
