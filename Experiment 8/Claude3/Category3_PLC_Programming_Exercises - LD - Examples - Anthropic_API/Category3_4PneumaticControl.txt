END_PROGRAM
```

This program does the following:

1. Defines variables for setpoints, sensor inputs, control valve output, and a 100ms control loop timer.

2. The control loop timer triggers the control logic every 100ms. 

3. Calculates flow error as the difference between measured flow and setpoint.

4. Calculates pressure errors as the difference between measured pressure and min/max limits.

5. Limits the flow error to 0-100% range and outputs to the control valve.

6. Limits the pressure errors to 0-100% range and outputs to the control valve.

The control valve position will adjust based on the flow and pressure errors to try to maintain the flow at 50 slpm and the pressure between 5.5 and 6 bar. The LIMIT function blocks prevent windup.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
