### Controlled Shutdown of a Steel Production Facility - Steps Overview

1. Secure the facility's external supplies, ensuring all raw material inputs are halted.
2. Initiate the cool-down process for critical machinery and plant areas.
3. Depressurize and secure gas lines and any chemical feed systems.
4. **Gradually reduce the furnace temperature by adjusting fuel gas flow to the burners over a 12-hour period.**
5. **Adjust the oxygen supply to maintain a fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5, ensuring efficient combustion during the shutdown.**
6. **Monitor and maintain coolant flows to critical areas to manage residual heat.**

### Control Narrative for Steps 4 to 6

**Step 4: Gradually Reducing Fuel Gas Flow to Burners**
- **Objective**: Reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners from 100% to 0% linearly over a 12-hour period.
- **Control Parameter**: Fuel Gas Flow Rate (FGFR)
- **Initial Value**: 100%
- **Final Value**: 0%
- **Duration**: 12 hours

**Step 5: Adjusting Oxygen Supply for Optimal Combustion**
- **Objective**: Adjust the oxygen supply to maintain a fuel gas to oxygen ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown process to ensure efficient combustion.
- **Control Parameters**: Oxygen Flow Rate (OFR), desired ratio = 1:2.5
- **Adjustment**: Based on the current fuel gas flow rate.

**Step 6: Monitor and Maintain Coolant Flows**
- **Objective**: Ensure coolant flows are maintained at adequate levels to manage residual heat in critical machinery.
- **Control Parameter**: Coolant Flow Rate (CFR)
- **Set Points**: Adjust according to critical areas' temperature sensors.

### IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram for Gradually Reducing Fuel Gas Flow Rate

```plaintext
|--[CTD:12h]------------------(MOV)---(OTL)---|
|                         FuelGasSetpoint    |
|                                            |
|--[ ]---------------------------------(OTE)--|
        Reset Timer
```

**Explanation**:
- `CTD:12h`: Down-counter timer set for 12 hours; decrements FGFR linearly over time.
- `MOV`: Moves the calculated fuel gas setpoint (based on the timer value) to the control variable.
- `OTL`: Turns on control to adjust the fuel gas flow.
- `OTE`: Resets the counter and operations, preparing the system for a potential next cycle or ensuring it stops at the end.

### IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram for Adjusting Oxygen Supply

```plaintext
|--[ ]-----------(MUL)----------------------(MOV)---(OTL)---|
                2.5 x FGFR                    OFR     
|
|--[ ]-----------------------------------------------(OTE)--|
        Condition or Event Triggering Oxygen Adjustment
```

**Explanation**:
- The first row utilizes `MUL` to calculate the oxygen flow rate (OFR) as 2.5 times the current Fuel Gas Flow Rate (FGFR).
- `MOV` is then used to move this calculated OFR value into the oxygen supply system's control variable.
- `OTL` represents the logic to execute the adjustment based on the computed value.
- `OTE` in the second row might be used to trigger or reset the oxygen supply adjustment based on specific conditions, such as reaching desired ratios or external control commands.

These ladder diagrams represent simplified versions for illustrative purposes. In an actual system, additional safety checks, interlocks, and more complex control algorithms may be necessary to ensure operational safety and efficiency.
