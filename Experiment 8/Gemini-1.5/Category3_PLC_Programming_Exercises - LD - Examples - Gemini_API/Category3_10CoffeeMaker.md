## Coffee Machine Ladder Diagram

Due to the complexity of the coffee machine, the Ladder Diagram will be divided into sections for clarity. 

**Section 1: Emergency Stop and Machine Start**

```

**Explanation:**

*   The Emergency Stop button directly controls a normally closed contact, halting the entire machine when pressed.
*   The Start button sets the `MachineRunning` coil, which activates the rest of the program.
*   The Stop button and `MachineRunning` coil form a latch circuit, allowing the machine to continue running until the Stop button is pressed.

**Section 2: Tank Level Monitoring and Valve Control**

(End of Ladder Diagram)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `CoffeeTankFull` and `MilkTankFull` represent sensors detecting full tanks. 
*   When both tanks are full and the machine is running, the `MixerTankFull` coil is activated. 
*   `CoffeeValveOpen` and `MilkValveOpen` control the respective valves, allowing filling of the mixer tank.
*   When the mixer tank is full, the coffee and milk valves close, and the mixer timer starts (in the next section).
*   The `CoffeeOnlyButton` and `CoffeeMilkButton` control the opening of the coffee and milk valves when the mixer tank is not full.

**Section 3: Mixer Timer and Output Valve**

(End of Ladder Diagram)
```

**Explanation:**

*   When the mixer tank is full, the `MixerTimer.Q` coil activates a timer (`TOF`) for 4 seconds.
*   After 4 seconds, the `MixerTimer.Q` output turns on, activating the `OutputValveOpen` coil and dispensing the beverage. 

**Additional Notes:**

*   This Ladder Diagram represents the core logic of the coffee machine. Additional rungs may be needed for detailed functionalities like tank level sensors, valve control mechanisms, and specific safety interlocks.
*   The exact implementation of timers, counters, and sensor inputs might vary depending on the specific PLC hardware and programming software used.
*   Remember to consult the manuals and documentation of your PLC system for specific instructions and syntax.
