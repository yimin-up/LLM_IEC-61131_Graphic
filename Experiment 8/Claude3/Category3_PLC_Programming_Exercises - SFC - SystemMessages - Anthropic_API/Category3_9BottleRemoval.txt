Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart program in ASCII art for the bottle packaging system you described:

S1: Conveyor ON
S2: Wait for bottle 
S3: Bottle detected
S4: Check if bottle empty
S5: Remove empty bottle
S6: Package full bottle

N: Normally open transition
P: Proximity sensor

This SFC has 6 steps:
1. S1 turns on the conveyor 
2. S2 waits for a bottle to be detected by sensor P
3. S3 is reached when a bottle is detected
4. S4 checks if the detected bottle is empty 
5. S5 removes the bottle if it is empty
6. S6 packages the bottle if it is full

The program will loop back to S2 to wait for the next bottle after either removing an empty one or packaging a full one. The normally open transition N ensures the conveyor stays on.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
