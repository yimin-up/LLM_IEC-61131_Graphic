For the cascade control system in an oil refinery described, let's define the inputs and outputs, and design the Ladder Diagram (LD) program accordingly.

### Step 1:#### Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Ladder Diagram, and the standard symbols they use.

- **Inputs**:
  - **Pressure Measurement (PM)**: The actual pressure within the vessel. Symbol: I1
  - **Pressure Setpoint (PSP)**: The desired pressure in the vessel that the system should maintain. Symbol: I2
  - **Flow Measurement (FM)**: The actual flow of oil into the vessel. Symbol: I3

- **Outputs**:
  - **Pressure Control Output (PCO)**: Controls the mechanism affecting the vessel¡¯s pressure (e.g., a valve for releasing pressure). Symbol: Q1
  - **Flow Control Output (FCO)**: Controls the flow of oil into the vessel. Symbol: Q2

### Step 2:#### Give the Ladder Diagram program.
Because we cannot depict graphical Ladder Diagram elements in ASCII, the description will simulate the diagram structure:

```
+----[>I1----+-----( )Q1
|     PSP    |
+----[>I2----+

+----[>I1----+----[>Q1----+-----( )Q2
|     PM     |     PCO    |
+----[>I3----+
```

### Step 3:#### Give the logical expressions for each rung.
- **Rung 1**: Pressure control logic, where the pressure measurement `I1` is compared to the pressure setpoint `I2`. If `I1 < I2`, activate `Q1` (Pressure Control Output).
  - **Expression**: `Q1 = (I1 < I2)`

- **Rung 2**: Flow control logic, taking the output of the pressure control as a part of its input. The actual flow `I3` is compared to the output of pressure control `Q1` (used as a setpoint here indirectly). If `I1 < Q1`, activate `Q2` (Flow Control Output).
  - **Expression**: `Q2 = (I1 < Q1) and (I3 < I1)`

### Step 4:#### Briefly describe the state machine of the Ladder Diagram.
The described Ladder Diagram controls a cascade system with two main states: pressure control (primary loop) and flow control (secondary loop). Initially, the system compares the actual pressure against the set pressure setpoint. Based on this comparison, it adjusts the pressure control output. This output effectively becomes an indirect setpoint for the flow control loop, where the flow control output is adjusted based on the pressure control state and the actual flow. This creates a dynamic interaction between pressure and flow control to maintain the desired pressure in the vessel.

### Step 5:#### Check the LD you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.
According to IEC 61131-3, the Ladder Diagram should correctly represent the logical operations necessary for achieving the control strategy. Each rung of the diagram represents a logical expression or operation that is carried out by the PLC. The inputs (e.g., `I1`, `I2`, and `I3`) and outputs (`Q1` and `Q2`) are clearly defined and used according to conventional practices. The LD follows standard symbols and connectivity rules, ensuring it could be implemented in a compliant PLC system for controlling pressure and flow in an oil refinery's vessel as part of a cascade control strategy.
