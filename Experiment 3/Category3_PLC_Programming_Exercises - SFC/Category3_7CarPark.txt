To design the PLC program for the Entry/Exit Control of the Underground Car Park using Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in accordance with IEC 61131-3, we will define our steps and transitions based on the description of the process and the role of sensors and actuators involved.

#### Initial Assumptions
- The system is at a "Ready" state initially, with green lights on (Y2=ON) and red lights off (Y1=OFF).
- A car's presence at either entry/exit point triggers a sequence to ensure safe passage.
- The transition conditions are based on sensor inputs (M1, M2, M3, M4).
- Following the complete passage of a car, the system returns to the "Ready" state.
- Intermediate states are used to represent the system during the car's passage.

#### Explanation of the Steps and Transitions:
- **Init**: Initial state of the PLC after power on or reset.
- **Ready**: System is ready for either incoming or outgoing traffic, with green lights on (Y2=ON) and red lights off (Y1=OFF).
- **M1 OR M2 Transition**: Detects a car at the ground floor entry/exit, prepares the system for passage from the ground floor.
- **M3 OR M4 Transition**: Detects a car at the basement entry/exit, prepares the system for passage from the basement.
- **Passage Clearing (Car at Ground Floor / Basement)**: Represents the process of a car passing through the passage. During this state, red lights are on (Y1=ON) to block further entry, green lights are off (Y2=OFF), and the corresponding M20 or M30 variable is set to ON indicating the ongoing process.
- **Passage**: Transition state indicating the next step in the sequence depending on the transition conditions being met.
- **Car at Ground Floor Transition**: Detects the completion of the passage for a car entering/exiting from the ground floor and prepares to return to the "Ready" state.
- **Car at Basement Transition**: Same as above but for cars entering/exiting from the basement.

This ASCII art SFC design outlines the logic but would need to be implemented with actual SFC programming tools or software complying with IEC 61131-3 for execution in a PLC system.
