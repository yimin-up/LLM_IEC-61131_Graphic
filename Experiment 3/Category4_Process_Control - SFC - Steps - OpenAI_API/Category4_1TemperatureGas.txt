Step 1:####
For implementing a PID feedback control for temperature inside a gas turbine, we must define the inputs and outputs to design the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) accurately.

Inputs:
1. `Temperature_Setpoint`: The desired temperature to maintain inside the gas turbine.
2. `Actual_Temperature`: The current temperature inside the gas turbine.

Outputs:
1. `Valve_Opening`: The variable controlling the opening of the inlet valve to regulate the temperature. It's a percentage value where 0% means fully closed, and 100% means fully opened.

####

Step 2:####
The state machine for the requirements will follow a simple yet effective process to maintain the target temperature within the gas turbine using PID control. 

1. **Initialization**: Set up initial conditions, ensure system readiness.
2. **Read Inputs**: Acquire the current temperature inside the gas turbine.
3. **PID Calculation**: Using PID logic, calculate the necessary adjustment to the inlet valve's position based on the difference between the desired setpoint and the actual temperature.
4. **Apply Output**: Adjust the inlet valve's opening to the calculated position.
5. **Loop**: The process from "Read Inputs" to "Apply Output" will loop continuously to maintain the temperature at the setpoint.

Note: To keep the demonstration straightforward, we're omitting detailed PID tuning parameters and focusing on the SFC structure.

Step 3:####
The Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII art for the described state machine would approximately look like this:

```
          +-----------+
          |Initialize |
          +-----------+
                 |
                 V
          /---------------\
    [Read Inputs] ----------> [PID Calculation] ----------> [Apply Output]
          \---------------/          |                            |
                                     V                            |
                                 /----------------\ <-------------+
                                 \    Loop Back    /
                                  \----------------/
```

####

Step 4:####
Explanation of each step, action, and transition:

- **Initialize**: Sets up the system for operation. It prepares the PID controller by initializing variables and checking system readiness. This step makes sure that the system can safely start controlling the turbine's temperature.

- **Read Inputs**: This step involves reading the `Actual_Temperature` from the sensors in the gas turbine and also considering the `Temperature_Setpoint` which could be a static value or dynamically adjusted.

- **PID Calculation**: In this state, the controller compares the `Actual_Temperature` to the `Temperature_Setpoint`, calculates the error, and then uses PID control logic to determine the necessary adjustment to the inlet valve's position (`Valve_Opening`). 

- **Apply Output**: This part of the process applies the calculated `Valve_Opening` adjustment to the physical inlet valve, potentially via an actuator control system or similar, to regulate the temperature inside the gas turbine.

- **Loop Back**: After applying the output, the process loops back to reading the inputs. This creates a continuous control loop that aims to maintain the turbine temperature at the setpoint through ongoing adjustments.

####

Step 5:####
The SFC generated above adheres to the IEC 61131 standard in its structure by providing a clear sequence of operations, from initialization to looping for continuous control. Each step is defined explicitly, and transitions are specified, allowing for predictable and organized progression through the control logic. This organization aids in ensuring that the control system is maintainable, understandable, and conducive to systematic troubleshooting or modifications.

The use of transitions, indicated by the vertical and horizontal arrows, makes it plain when and how the control logic proceeds from one action to a subsequent action. This visual representation is part of what makes SFCs under IEC 61131-3 a valuable tool for designing and understanding control logic sequences. The SFC chart should be complemented with actual PLC programming code that implements the PID algorithm, following the structure outlined in the SFC for practical deployment.
