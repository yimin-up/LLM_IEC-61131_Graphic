To create a Ladder Diagram (LD) program for implementing PID feedback control for the pressure in a chemical reactor according to IEC 61131-3, we need to clarify the requirements and limitations inherent to the PLC programming environment. Implementing a PID controller in a ladder logic program requires careful consideration due to the complexity of PID algorithms compared to the typically straightforward logic operations found in ladder logic. Normally, PID control is integrated into PLCs as a function or function block, rather than being explicitly programmed in ladder logic. However, a simplified representation can be constructed for educational purposes.

#### Step 1:
Inputs:
- **Pressure Sensor Input (PSI)**: Analog Input that represents the current pressure in the reactor. Symbol: I:AnalogInput0
- **Set Point (SP)**: Desired pressure value. This could be an input from an HMI (Human Machine Interface) or a preset constant. Symbol: SP (Memory or Constant)

Outputs:
- **Control Valve (CV)**: Analog Output to adjust the reactor's pressure. Symbol: Q:AnalogOutput0

Symbols used in ASCII Ladder Diagram:
- **|--**(contact NO) represents a normally open contact.
- **|--|** (contact NC) represents a normally closed contact.
- **( )** represents a coil.
- **---|/|---** represents a block (for function or function block invocation, such as PID).

#### Step 2:
Given the abstract nature of PID control and the constraints of ASCII art, the following represents a very conceptual ladder diagram focusing on the feedback loop rather than the internal workings of the PID algorithm.

```
       +----------------+  
       |      SP        |  
       |   PID Block    |  
       |       PID      |----( Q:AnalogOutput0 )   
       +---||-----||----+  
          PSI     SP  
```

This "diagram" essentially imagines a PID block that takes the Set Point (SP) and the Pressure Sensor Input (PSI) as inputs and calculates the output signal to the Control Valve (CV) to maintain the desired pressure.

#### Step 3:
Logical Expression:
```
CV = PID(SP, PSI)
```
This expression simplifies the operation of the PID control, where the output to the control valve (CV) is determined by a PID function that takes the set point (SP) and the current pressure sensor input (PSI) as arguments.

#### Step 4:
The state machine for this conceptual Ladder Diagram is centered around continuous monitoring and adjustment:
1. **Initialization**: Parameters for PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative constants) are initialized.
2. **Read Input**: The current pressure (PSI) is read.
3. **PID Calculation**: The PID function block calculates the necessary adjustment based on the difference between the set point (SP) and the PSI.
4. **Adjust Output**: The calculated adjustment is applied to the control valve (CV) to correct the pressure.
5. **Loop**: Return to step 2, continuously adjusting in response to changes in pressure.

This control loop operates continuously, with rapid iterations to maintain the pressure at the desired set point with minimal error and overshoot.

#### Step 5:
Checking the LD according to IEC 61131 standard involves ensuring:
- The use of symbols and structures is consistent with the standard's definitions.
- The PID control implementation, if detailed, should adhere to best practices for real-time control and stability (not fully represented in the simplistic diagram).
- The diagram's inputs and outputs are correctly defined and allocated as per the PLC's configuration and capabilities.
- Ensure that the PID block (abstracted in the diagram) is properly parameterized with tuning constants suited for the process's dynamics.

This response creates a conceptual groundwork. In practice, the PID function would be encapsulated within a PID controller block, following the computational aspects outlined in the IEC 61131-3 standard for function blocks, and significantly detailed programming configuration beyond the scope of simple ASCII ladder logic representation.
