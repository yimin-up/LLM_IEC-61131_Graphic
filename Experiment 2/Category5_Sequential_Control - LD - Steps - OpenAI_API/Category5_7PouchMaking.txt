Given your requirements for a 3D pouch making machine, let's proceed step by step according to the IEC 61131-3 standard for crafting a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence Ladder Diagram (LD).

### Step 1:#### List the Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**
- I1: Start Button
- I2: Stop Button
- I3: Emergency Stop
- I4: Raw Material Presence Sensor (Feeder Unit 1)
- I5: Raw Material Presence Sensor (Feeder Unit 2)
- I6: Tension OK (Feeder Unit 1)
- I7: Tension OK (Feeder Unit 2)
- I8: Temperature OK (Heating Stations)
- I9: Cooling OK (Cooling Stations)

**Outputs:**
- Q1: Feeder Unit 1 On
- Q2: Feeder Unit 2 On
- Q3: Heating Stations On
- Q4: Cooling Stations On
- Q5: Horizontal Cutter On
- Q6: Vertical Cutter On

**Symbols Used:**
- |--[ ]--| : Normally Open Contact
- |--[/]--| : Normally Closed Contact
- (--[ ]--) : Coil

### Step 2:#### Ladder Diagram Program

The LD will be detailed as ASCII art:

```
Start and Heating Sequence
|--[I1]--[/I3]--[/I2]--(Q3)--|
|--[I8]--(Q1)--|
|--[I8]--(Q2)--|

Cooling and Cutting Sequence (Activated after Heating is OK)
|--[I9]--(Q4)--|
|--[Q4]--(Q5)--|
|--[Q4]--(Q6)--|

Tension Control and Material Presence
|--[I4]--[/I3]--[--I6]--(Q1)--|
|--[I5]--[/I3]--[--I7]--(Q2)--|

Shutdown Sequence
|--[/I2]--[/I3]--(Q1)--|
|--[/I2]--[/I3]--(Q2)--|
|--[/I2]--[/I3]--(Q3)--|
|--[/I2]--(Q4)--|
|--[/I2]--(Q5)--|
|--[/I2]--(Q6)--|
```

### Step 3:#### Logical Expressions for Each Rung

1. `Start and Heating On`: `(Start AND NOT Emergency Stop AND NOT Stop) THEN Heating ON`
2. `Feeder Unit 1 On After Heating`: `(Temperature OK) THEN Feeder Unit 1 ON`
3. `Feeder Unit 2 On After Heating`: `(Temperature OK) THEN Feeder Unit 2 ON`
4. `Cooling On`: `(Cooling OK) THEN Cooling Stations ON`
5. `Horizontal Cutter On`: `(Cooling Stations ON) THEN Horizontal Cutter ON`
6. `Vertical Cutter On`: `(Cooling Stations ON) THEN Vertical Cutter ON`
7. `Tension and Material Presence OK for Feeder 1`: `(Raw Material Sensor 1 AND NOT Emergency Stop AND Tension OK) THEN Feeder Unit 1 ON`
8. `Tension and Material Presence OK for Feeder 2`: `(Raw Material Sensor 2 AND NOT Emergency Stop AND Tension OK) THEN Feeder Unit 2 ON`
9. `Feeder, Heating, Cooling, and Cutters Off on Stop`: For each unit, the logic follows: `(Stop AND NOT Emergency Stop) THEN Unit OFF`

### Step 4:#### State Machine of the Ladder Diagram

The state machine for this machinery operation can be described as follows:

- **State 0: Idle/Stop** - All operations are off. Transition from Idle to Start condition when Start is pressed and raw material is present.
- **State 1: Start-Up** - Begin heating process. Once temperature OK, feeders are activated.
- **State 2: Operation** - Cooling stations and cutters activate after the heating process is complete and maintain operation as long as conditions are met.
- **State 3: Tension Control** - Continuously checks tension in feeder units and adjusts operation accordingly.
- **State 4: Emergency/Stop** - Any operation stops immediately if the Stop button is pressed or Emergency Stop is triggered.

### Step 5:#### IEC 61131-3 Standard Check

The proposed Ladder Diagram adheres to IEC 61131-3 standards by following:

- Systematic usage of inputs and outputs within the Ladder Logic complying with naming and operation conventions.
- Deployment of both start-up and shutdown sequences, including emergency stop considerations.
- Including tension control mechanisms and real-time adjustments to operation based on sensor feedback, which are part of advanced control systems and safety measures.
- Clear definition, enabling easier troubleshooting, modification, and compliance with safety and operational standards of machinery control.
