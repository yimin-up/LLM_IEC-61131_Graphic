Creating an ASCII art representation for a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) specially tailored for a PID feedback pH control system using the IEC 61131-3 standard requires a concise understanding of both the structure of SFCs and the PID control mechanism. The system design focuses on maintaining the pH level of a solution within a desired range by adjusting the addition of acid or base, depending on the current pH measurement.

**Note:** The actual implementation of PID control logic (calculating the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative components) is not depicted in detail due to complexity and space constraints. Instead, this SFC focuses on the high-level process states and transitions involved in pH adjustments.

Given that SFC comprises Steps, Actions, and Transitions, our program will be divided accordingly. Let's start with a simple scheme:

1. **Initialization (Init)**: System checks and initial parameter setup.
2. **Measurement (Measure)**: pH level measurement.
3. **Decision (Decide)**: Determine if pH correction is needed.
4. **Adjustment (Adjust)**: Apply correction by adding acid or base.
5. **Hold (Hold)**: Wait for the solution to mix and stabilize.
6. **Loopback to Measurement for continuous operation.

### Explanation of Steps:

1. **Initialization**: The system is prepared, all necessary variables are initialized, and any required system checks are performed.
2. **Measurement**: The current pH level of the solution is measured.
3. **Decision**: The program decides whether or not the pH needs adjustment. If not, it loops back to Measurement for continuous monitoring.
4. **Adjustment**: If the pH level is outside the desired range, the program calculates the required amount of acid or base to add to the solution.
5. **Hold**: After adding the correcting agent (acid/base), the system waits for a predetermined period for the solution to mix and stabilize.
6. **End**: This could lead to a safe state or looping back to Measurement for continuous operation.

### Important Notes:

- The PID control logic fits primarily within the "Adjustment" step but was abstracted for simplicity.
- The conditions for transitions between steps (especially within "Decision") depend on comparing the measured pH value against set thresholds.
- The exact timing for the "Hold" state depends on system characteristics and must be determined experimentally or based on process knowledge.
- Error handling, system monitoring, and safety mechanisms should be integrated into a real-world application but are beyond the scope of this simplified representation.

This SFC design provides a structured framework for developing a PID feedback control system focused on pH level adjustments. The detailed implementation, especially for PID calculations, needs to follow the specifics of the IEC 61131-3 standard for programming PLCs.
