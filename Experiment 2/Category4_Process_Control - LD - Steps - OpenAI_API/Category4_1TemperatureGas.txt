To address this requirement, let's break it down according to the steps:

### Step 1:####
Inputs:
- `T_actual`: The current temperature inside the gas turbine.
  - Symbol: `I` (for Input)
- `T_setpoint`: The desired temperature setpoint.
  - Symbol: `-| |-` (Normally Open Contact)

Outputs:
- `Valve_opening` : The amount the inlet valve is open to adjust the temperature. This would typically be a value between 0-100%.
  - Symbol: `( )` (Coil)

####

### Step 2:####
Given the complexity of implementing a PID controller entirely in Ladder Diagram ASCII art and the fact PID algorithms involve continuous feedback and calculations not readily expressible in simple ladder logic symbols, a simplified conceptual representation will be provided.

```
+----[SUB]----+----[/]----+----[PID]----+----( )----+
| T_setpoint  | T_actual | PID_Calc    | Valve_opening
|             |          | calculation |          
+-------------+----------+-------------+------------+
```

This diagram is highly abstracted. It represents taking the setpoint and the actual temperature, calculating the error, performing the PID calculation (`PID_Calc`), and then outputting to control the valve opening. Note, detailed PID calculation logic is abstracted by the `PID` block, as direct implementation in Ladder logic would involve complex arithmetic not suited for ASCII representation.

####

### Step 3:####
Given the ladder diagram, the logical expressions are more conceptual due to the nature of PID control. 

- `Valve_opening = PID_Calc(T_setpoint - T_actual)`

This expression represents the PID calculation where the error between the desired setpoint and the actual temperature is computed, and the PID algorithm determines the appropriate valve opening percentage to minimize this error.

####

### Step 4:####
The state machine of this simplified Ladder Diagram can be described as:
1. **Initialization**: The system starts, and variables are initialized. If required, a self-tuning routine for the PID parameters could run here.
2. **Measurement**: Continuously measure the actual temperature `T_actual` inside the gas turbine.
3. **Calculation**: Calculate the difference between `T_setpoint` and `T_actual`, then apply the PID algorithm to determine the required adjustment to the inlet valve opening (`Valve_opening`).
4. **Actuation**: Adjust the inlet valve based on the `Valve_opening` value from the PID calculation to achieve the desired temperature.
5. **Feedback Loop**: This process repeats, allowing for dynamic adjustments to maintain the temperature at `T_setpoint`.

The process continuously loops through steps 2-4, forming a feedback control loop.

####

### Step 5:####
The Ladder Diagram checking according to the IEC 61131 standard involves:
- **Syntax and Semantics Verification**: Ensuring the diagram's components and their connections are correctly represented according to IEC 61131-3 standards. In this simplified representation, we abstract complex PID calculations with a `PID` block, assuming an existing compliant implementation.
- **Operational Integrity**: Verifying that the loop can execute without causing unsafe states or oscillations. This is partly design and partly parameter tuning within the PID controller.
- **Resource Constraints**: Ensuring the PLC can handle the computational load, especially important in real-time PID control. This verification is more about the hardware and runtime environment than the diagram itself.

Because we've abstracted many details, the detailed compliance check is conceptual. In a real-world scenario, each component (including the PID algorithm, subtraction, and division operations) would need to meet the standard's requirements for ladder logic representation, timing considerations, and execution safety.

####

This breakdown offers a conceptual path from the requirements through to a basic logical framework for implementing PID feedback control in IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram form, noting the practical limitations of representing complex control algorithms in simplified ASCII ladder diagram formats.
