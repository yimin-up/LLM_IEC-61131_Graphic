Given the complexity of the coffee machine operation, here's a simplified version of how a PLC Ladder Diagram program might look to control the machine based on the requirements specified. This diagram abstracts some of the direct sensor and valve control logic for simplicity but captures the essential sequences and safety mechanisms.

Key Elements:
- Emergency Stop: Directly resets all operations providing a safety mechanism.
- Start: Initiates the machine operation sequence.
- Coffee & Milk Button: Signifies both coffee and milk are to be dispensed.
- Coffee Button: Signifies only coffee is to be dispensed (not shown in detail).
- ValveC: Represents the coffee valve.
- ValveM: Represents the milk valve (implied logic, not directly shown in ASCII diagram).
- Mixture Valve (MixValve): Controls the output of the mixed/cooked product.
- MixerTime: A timer controlling the mixing process lasting for a specified duration (4 seconds).
- LvlSensor=130ml: A level sensor in the mixer tank, ensures mixing begins once 130ml is reached.
- Reset: Allows the system to be reset following an emergency stop or as needed.

This Ladder Diagram is broad and provides a foundational overview rather than detailed logic for every step, due to complexity and space. For a fully functional implementation, each component (valves, buttons, timers, and sensors) must be meticulously programmed, ensuring that all interdependencies are handled securely to avoid any unexpected conditions during the coffee-making process.
