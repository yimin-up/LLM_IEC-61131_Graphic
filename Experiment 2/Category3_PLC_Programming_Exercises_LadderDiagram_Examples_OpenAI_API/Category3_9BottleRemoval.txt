Given the requirements, I'll outline a ladder logic program for the packaging bottles scenario. Note that in an actual implementation, the specific functionality and connectivity might require adjustments based on the hardware and software environment.

**Ladder Diagram Program Description:**

1. **Conveyor Control**: The conveyor moves bottles towards the packaging area. It operates when there are bottles to be packaged and stops if there are no bottles detected or only empty bottles are sensed.
2. **Bottle Detection**: A proximity sensor detects the presence of any bottle. This sensor's output is used to control the conveyor and the cylinder.
3. **Empty Bottle Detection and Removal**: Another sensor detects only empty bottles. When an empty bottle is detected, a cylinder is activated to remove the empty bottle from the conveyor.

**Explanation**:
- **Line 1**: When the `ProximitySensor` detects any bottle (filled or empty), the conveyor motor (`ConveyorMotor`) is energized, moving the bottles towards the packaging area.
- **Line 2**: If an empty bottle is detected by the `EmptyBottleSensor`, the cylinder (`Cylinder`) is activated to remove the empty bottle from the conveyor.

**Assumptions**:
- This program assumes that the `ProximitySensor` is able to continuously detect bottles, and it activates the conveyor as long as bottles are present.
- The `EmptyBottleSensor` specifically detects only empty bottles to trigger the cylinder for removal.
- The logic for stopping the conveyor when only empty bottles are present or when there are no bottles at all (significantly dependent on the behavior of `ProximitySensor`) is simplified for demonstration purposes.

**Further Considerations**:
- Implementations might require additional considerations like debounce logic for sensors, fail-safe states, and specific actions upon detecting only empty bottles (e.g., stopping the conveyor might also involve separate logic).
- The time delay for cylinder operation or conditions for restarting the conveyor after an empty bottle is removed might be necessary based on practical applications.
