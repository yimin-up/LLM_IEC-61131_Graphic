**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Step:** The system starts in the "Initial" step.
2. **Car Detection and Safety Check:** The program checks if a car is present (`CarPresent`) and no human is detected (`NOT HumanPresent`). If both conditions are true, it transitions to the "StartWash" step.
3. **Start Washing:**
    - The "StartWash" step activates the washing process. 
    - It turns on the motor (`StartMotor`) and opens the water valve (`OpenWater`).
4. **Washing Time Control:** 
    - The program waits for a pre-defined washing time (`WashTimeElapsed`) to elapse.
5. **Stop Washing:**
    - Once the washing time is complete, the "StopWash" step is activated.
    - It closes the water valve (`CloseWater`) and stops the motor (`StopMotor`).
6. **Human Detection and Alarm:**
    - If a human is detected (`HumanPresent`) at any point during the washing process, the program transitions to the "Alarm" step.
    - This step activates an alarm (`AlarmOn`), closes the water valve (`CloseWater`), and stops the motor (`StopMotor`) to ensure safety.

**Additional Considerations:**

- You will need to define the variables and data types for:
    - `CarPresent`: Boolean input representing the car detection sensor.
    - `HumanPresent`: Boolean input representing the human detection sensor.
    - `StartMotor`: Boolean output to control the car wash motor. 
    - `OpenWater`: Boolean output to control the water valve.
    - `CloseWater`: Boolean output to control the water valve.
    - `StopMotor`: Boolean output to control the car wash motor.
    - `AlarmOn`: Boolean output to activate the alarm.
    - `WashTimeElapsed`: Time variable or counter to track the washing duration.
-  You may also need to add additional steps and transitions depending on the specific requirements of the car wash station, such as rinsing, drying, or different wash cycles.
