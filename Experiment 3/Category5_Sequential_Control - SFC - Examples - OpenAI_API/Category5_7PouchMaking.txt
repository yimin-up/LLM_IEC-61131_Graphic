Given the complexity of a 3D pouch making machine, we'll create a simplified version of the start-up and shutdown sequences to fit the format of an IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart in ASCII art. This representation will focus on key steps and assume a logical flow where safety and operational integrity are prioritized. 

### Start-up Sequence 
1. **System Initialization**: Check all sensors and safety measures.
2. **Material Feeding Setup**: Ensure both feeder units are ready and loaded with raw material.
3. **Tension Control Activation**: Activate winding tension controls for both feeder units.
4. **Heating Stations Activation**: Sequentially start up the 8 heating stations to reach operational temperature.
5. **Cooling Stations Standby**: Ensure cooling stations are in standby and ready to activate.
6. **Movement Systems Check**: Verify horizontal and vertical cutters' readiness.
7. **Production Start**: Begin with the first pouch, engaging the feeders, heating, then cooling stations, and finally cutting.

### Shutdown Sequence
1. **Production Halt**: Cease production and ensure the last pouch completes the cycle.
2. **Cooling Stations Shutdown**: Sequentially turn off all cooling stations.
3. **Heating Stations Cooldown**: Initiate the cooldown process for heating stations.
4. **Tension Unload**: Safely reduce tension in feeder units.
5. **Material Feeding Stop**: Stop material feed and secure raw material.
6. **System Power Down**: Turn off cutters and other movable parts.
7. **Shutdown Complete**: Final checks to ensure the machine is safely shut down.

### Sequential Function Chart Representation
Due to the complexity, only the start-up sequence is detailed below:

Please note, this ASCII chart is simplified and does not detail the full operational logic, error handling, or synchronous tasks that may run in parallel or need additional interlocks and conditions for transitions. In a real-world scenario, the PLC programming would require much more detail, including specific conditions for transitions between steps (e.g., temperature thresholds, tension levels), error detection and recovery procedures, and possibly interlocks to prevent steps from proceeding if conditions are not met.
