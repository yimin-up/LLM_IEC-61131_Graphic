Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program in ASCII art to control a traffic light system with pedestrian buttons and emergency vehicle priority:

This provides the basic traffic light sequencing, pedestrian crossings when a button is pushed, and emergency vehicle preemption to set all lights to red. Timers control the duration of each light. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!
