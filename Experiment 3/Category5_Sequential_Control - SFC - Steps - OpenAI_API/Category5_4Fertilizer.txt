#### Step 1:####
Inputs: 
- TempSensor: Temperature sensor input (°„C)
- PressureSensor: Pressure sensor input (bar)
- StartProcess: Start process button (Boolean)
- StopProcess: Stop process button (Boolean)

Outputs: 
- Heater: Control heater (Boolean)
- Cooler: Control cooler (Boolean)
- PressureValve: Control Pressure Valve (Boolean)

#### Step 2:####
The state machine for the reaction stage consists of the following states:
1. **Initialization**: Setup of initial conditions before starting the process.
2. **Heating**: Increase the temperature to the required level for the reaction to occur.
3. **Reaction**: Maintain temperature and pressure for a specified time to ensure completion of the chemical reaction.
4. **Cooling**: Decrease the temperature after the reaction is complete.
5. **PressureRegulation**: Adjust the pressure within the system to safe levels throughout the process.
6. **EndProcess**: The process is stopped, and all equipment is safely turned off.

+---------+--------------+  
          |
          |<StopProcess>
          v         
   +--[EndProcess]--+  
   | Stop all       |  
   +----------------+  
```

#### Step 4:####
- **Initialization**: Prepares the system for starting the process, ensuring that all conditions are safe for operation.
- **Heating**: The heater is activated until the temperature reaches 450°„C. The action will be controlling the `Heater` output based on `TempSensor`.
- **Reaction**: In this state, the temperature is maintained at 450°„C, and pressure should not exceed 200 bar. Based on `TempSensor` and `PressureSensor`, actions may involve adjusting the `Heater`, `Cooler`, and `PressureValve` to maintain these conditions.
- **Cooling**: After the reaction is complete, this state cools down the system to 200°„C. The `Cooler` is activated as needed.
- **PressureRegulation**: Independently or as part of the Cooling state, ensures pressure is reduced to safe levels (<150 bar). Adjusts `PressureValve` based on `PressureSensor`.
- **EndProcess**: Shuts down all operations, ensuring the system is safely deactivated.

The transitions are based on sensor inputs reaching specific set points or conditions, like `StartProcess`, temperature or pressure values being within a certain range, and `StopProcess`. Timing (e.g., for the reaction state) can be handled with internal timers set to the required durations.

#### Step 5:####
According to the IEC 61131-3 standard, the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) follows the guidelines by:
- Clearly defining states (steps) and their specific conditions for transitions, aligning with structured programming approaches.
- Using inputs and outputs that are related to real-world sensors and actuators, adhering to practical implementation considerations.
- Providing a visual and logical flow from start to end, facilitating understanding and troubleshooting of the process control logic.
- Including conditions for safety and proper sequence of operations, which is critical for batch process control like in chemical manufacturing.
