Designing a complete Sequential Function Chart program for an elevator system in a 5-floor building, considering the IEC 61131-3 standards and incorporating all the given requirements, yields a complex process. Therefore, I'll provide an outline capturing the main states and transitions needed for the control logic. This simplification involves essential aspects such as floor detection, door control, timers, and directional movement based on button press inputs.

**Simplified Sequential Function Chart (SFC) Outline:**

Note: Due to the format limitations, a textual description of each step is provided, assuming familiarity with creating actual SFC diagrams and programming them accordingly.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the system to a known state, like the elevator parked at the first floor with doors closed.

2. **WaitForCall:**
   - Monitor button presses (up, down, and call buttons on each floor and inside the cabin).
   - Transition to the appropriate movement state based on the closest call in the current or desired direction of movement.

3. **MoveUp or MoveDown:**
   - Move the elevator in the desired direction.
   - Check for the top and bottom limit switches on each floor to avoid overrun.
   - Transition to the door-opening state if a corresponding button for a floor is pressed or if arrival at a called floor is detected.

4. **OpenDoors:**
   - Start a 7-second timer for the door to stay open.
   - Transition to WaitInOpen state when the timer elapses or immediately if a destination button press is detected.

5. **WaitInOpen:**
   - If no button press is detected within 10 seconds, start a timer for 10 seconds to keep the door open waiting for a command. 
   - If a button is pressed, reset this timer.
   - Transition back to MoveUp or MoveDown based on the new target floor selection or current direction.

6. **SelectDirection:**
   - Based on the current floor and requested destinations, decide whether to move up or down.

7. **Emergency:**
   - An additional state to handle unexpected issues (e.g., door malfunction, emergency button pressed). Acts according to safety protocols, like moving to the nearest floor and opening the doors.

**Transitions** between these states would be governed by:
- The arrival at floors (detected by limit switches).
- The completion of timers for door states.
- The button presses inside the cabin or on floors dictating movement direction or specific floor requests.
- Emergency conditions.

**Assumptions**:
- The program assumes all sensors, buttons, and actuators are appropriately interfaced with the PLC.
- Safety interlocks and emergency states must always override operational commands.
- Floor determination relies on sensor inputs from top and bottom limit switches on every floor.

Due to the complexity and safety-critical nature of elevator control systems, the described flow is a simplified overview. Actual implementations would require more detailed conditions for safety, maintenance modes, and specific handling for corner cases (e.g., all buttons pressed in sequence, handling simultaneous button presses from multiple floors directing opposite travel directions, etc.).
