Step 2:####
The state machine for this batch control process includes the following sequential states:
1. Raw Material Preparation: Preparing the raw materials required for the batch.
2. Polymerization: Transforming the raw materials into polyethylene through a chemical process.
3. Quenching: Rapid cooling of the polyethylene to stop the polymerization process.
4. Drying: Removing any residual moisture from the polyethylene.
5. Pelletizing: Cutting the polyethylene into small, manageable pellets.
6. Quality Control: Checking the quality of the pellets to ensure they meet standards.
7. Packaging: Packing the pellets into suitable containers for storage and shipping.
8. Storage: Storing the packaged product until it is dispatched.

Transitions between states are triggered by the completion signals of the preceding actions.

Step 4:####
1. Prepare_Raw_Material: On receiving the Start_Process signal, the process starts with raw material preparation.
2. Start_Polymerization: Once Raw_Material_Ready, the polymerization stage is initiated.
3. Start_Quenching: Following the Polymerization_Complete signal, the quenching process starts.
4. Start_Drying: After quenching (Quenching_Done), the drying stage is initiated to remove moisture.
5. Start_Pelletizing: Post-drying, the pelletizing steps make the product manageable for testing and packaging.
6. Conduct_Quality_Control: After Pelletizing_Finished, quality control ensures product standards before packaging.
7. Start_Packaging: With Quality_Control_Pass, the packaging process begins.
8. Store_Product: Once Packaging_Done, the final product is moved to storage.

Transitions are contingent upon the completion of each stage, ensuring a sequential flow that is crucial for batch processing integrity.

Step 5:####
The SFC adheres to IEC 61131-3 standards by:
- Using clearly defined process steps.
- Employing transitions based on process completion signals.
- Structuring in a sequential logic flow that ensures no step begins before its prerequisite step is completed.
- Utilizing input and output signals effectively to drive actions within each step.
This compliance ensures a robust design that is maintainable, scalable, and easy to diagnose or troubleshoot, aligning with industrial standards for process control automation.
