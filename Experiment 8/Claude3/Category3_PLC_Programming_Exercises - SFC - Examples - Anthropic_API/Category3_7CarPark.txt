Explanation:
1. The Initial step sets the green lights (Y2) ON and red lights (Y1) OFF when the PLC starts.

2. The GreenOn step keeps the green lights ON and red lights OFF when no car is entering the passage (M20 and M30 are OFF).

3. When a car enters from the ground floor (M1) or leaves the basement (M4), the RedOnM20 step turns the red lights ON, green lights OFF, and sets M20 to indicate a car is in the passage from the ground floor.

4. When the car from the ground floor completely passes through the passage (M2), the M20_Reset step resets M20.

5. Similarly, when a car leaves the basement (M2) or enters from the ground floor (M3), the RedOnM30 step turns the red lights ON, green lights OFF, and sets M30 to indicate a car is in the passage from the basement.

6. When the car from the basement completely passes through the passage (M1), the M30_Reset step resets M30.

7. The process repeats, allowing cars to enter and leave while ensuring only one direction of traffic at a time.
