Here's a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program for the coffee machine based on the given requirements:

```
PROGRAM CoffeeMachine

  EmergencyStop: BOOL;
  StartButton: BOOL;
  CoffeeAndMilkButton: BOOL;
  CoffeeOnlyButton: BOOL;
  CoffeeValve: BOOL;
  MilkValve: BOOL;
  OutputValve: BOOL;
  MixerTank: INT;
  MixerTimer: TON;
  MixerRunning: BOOL;
END_VAR

Explanation:
1. Network 1: The emergency stop button is used to halt the machine instantly. When pressed, it closes all valves and stops the mixer.
2. Network 2: The start button is used to open the coffee and milk valves to begin filling the mixer tank.
3. Network 3: The coffee and milk button is used to select both coffee and milk. It opens both the coffee and milk valves.
4. Network 4: The coffee only button is used to select only coffee. It opens only the coffee valve.
5. Network 5: When the mixer tank reaches the maximum level of 130ml, it closes the coffee and milk valves and starts the mixer.
6. Network 6: The mixer timer is set to run for 4 seconds. When the mixer is running, the timer starts counting.
7. Network 7: When the mixer timer reaches 4 seconds, it opens the output valve to dispense the output.

Note: This is a simplified representation of the Ladder Diagram program using ASCII art. In an actual PLC programming environment, the symbols and layout may differ slightly.
