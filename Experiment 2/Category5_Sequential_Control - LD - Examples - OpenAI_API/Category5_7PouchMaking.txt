Creating a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for a 3D pouch making machine with the complexity described, showcasing 8 heating and 8 cooling stations, cutters, and feeder units, requires a careful approach to ensure safety, functionality, and efficiency. Here's a simplified representation of how sequences could be logically divided and controlled using IEC 61131-3 standards. Given the complexity, this outline will illustrate the concept in sections that could be combined into a comprehensive program.

### Start-Up Sequence:
1. **Initialize System**: Ensure all systems are in a safe state before starting.
2. **Start Feeder Units**: Ramp up feeder units to achieve required tension in raw material. Monitor tension.
3. **Heating Stations**: Sequentially activate heating stations to reach operational temperature.
4. **Cooling Stations**: Verify heating stations are at operational temperatures before activating cooling stations, ensuring material is treated correctly.
5. **Cutter Activation**: Activate cutters only when the material is correctly aligned and has passed through all previous stations as needed.

### Shutdown Sequence:
1. **Cutter Deactivation**: Ensure cutters are deactivated and safely positioned.
2. **Cooling Stations Shutdown**: Sequentially deactivate cooling stations.
3. **Heating Stations Shutdown**: Begin the cooling process for heating stations, ensuring they reach a safe temperature before complete deactivation.
4. **Feeder Units Shutdown**: Slowly decrease the tension to stop the feeder units, ensuring no abrupt stop that could damage the material.
5. **System Check & Safe State**: Ensure the machine is in a safe state, checking for any abnormalities before the complete shutdown.

### Ladder Diagram Concept:
Given the vastness and the process complexity, a comprehensive Ladder Diagram is extensive. Below is a simplified version focusing on one aspect for clarity¡ªstarting the heating stations in sequence.

+-----|/|-------------+-----| |------------(S) Heater1_ON
|                                           |
|  Heater1_ON        Temp_OK_Heater2        |
+-----| |-------------+-----| |------------(S) Heater2_ON
|                                           |
|  Heater2_ON        ...                    |
+-----| |-----------------------------------(S) ...
|                                           |
|  ...                        Temp_OK_Heater8|
+-----| |---------------------+----| |------(S) Heater8_ON
|                                           |

### Notes:
- `System_Start` is a condition that initiates the start-up sequence.
- `Temp_OK_HeaterX` is a condition ensuring each heater reaches operational temperature before the next starts.
- `HeaterX_ON` represents output coils that activate each heater, following a safe and sequential start-up process.
- Shutting down would involve reversing this sequence, ensuring each component is safely deactivated.
- Due to the complexity of the machine, specific safety interlocks, error handling, detailed feedback from each station for precise control, and synchronization mechanisms between heating/cooling and material feeding/cutting must be considered in a full implementation.

This is a high-level concept. A real-world application would require detailed input/output mappings, specific logic for handling operational exceptions, emergency stop sequences, and potentially integration with a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system for monitoring and control.
