**Explanation:**

1. **Inputs:**
    * `Sensor Car`: This input is activated (TRUE) when a car is detected in the washing station.
    * `Sensor Human`: This input is activated (TRUE) when a human is detected in the car wash area.
2. **Outputs:**
    * `P`: This output activates the car wash process (e.g., water pump, brushes).
    * `S`: This sets the latch to keep the car wash process running.
    * `R`: This resets the latch and stops the car wash process.
3. **Logic:**
    * The first rung checks if a car is present and no human is detected. If both conditions are met, it sets the latch `S` which activates the output `P` to start the car wash process.
    * The second rung checks if the latch `S` is set and if either a human is detected or the car is no longer present. If either condition is met, it resets the latch `R` which deactivates the output `P` to stop the car wash process.
    * This program ensures the car wash process only runs when a car is present and no human is in danger.

**Additional Considerations:**

* This program is a basic example and may require additional logic depending on the specific requirements of the car wash system. 
* You might need to add timers to control the duration of the car wash process and delays between washes. 
* Consider adding an alarm output that activates when the system detects a human during the wash process. 
* Remember to configure the sensors and outputs according to the specific hardware used in the car wash system.

**IEC 61131-3 Compliance:**

* This LD program follows the basic syntax and structure defined in the IEC 61131-3 standard for Ladder Diagrams. 
* It uses standard symbols for inputs, outputs, contacts, coils, and functions. 
* The logic flow is clear and easy to understand.
