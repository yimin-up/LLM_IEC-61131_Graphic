Given the complexity and safety requirements of a coffee machine control system, below is a simplified Sequential Function Chart (SFC) that models the operation based on the requirements provided. The chart is divided into different steps, each representing a key state or operation in the coffee-making process.

**Description of the Operations:**

1. **Initial**: The machine is in an idle state, waiting for input.
2. **Start**: When button 2 is pressed, the cycle begins based on the selection. If the emergency stop button (Button 1) is pressed at any point, it transitions to the "Stop" state.
3. **Coffee+Milk/ CoffeeOnly**: Depending on the selection via button 3 or button 4, the respective valves open to allow coffee and milk or just coffee into the mixer tank.
4. **Mixer_Fill**: The system waits until the mixer tank level reaches 130ml. In case of emergency, it transitions to "Stop".
5. **Mixing (4 seconds)**: The mixer operates for a preset duration of 4 seconds. This is handled using a timer. Upon expiration or if an emergency stop is initiated, it moves to the next step or stops, respectively.
6. **Dispense**: After mixing, the output valve opens to dispense.
7. **Stop**: This state is effective if the Emergency Stop button is pressed at any time, halting operation instantly for safety.

This is a basic model, and real implementation would require interlocks, safety checks, and more detailed handling, including the management of fault conditions not covered in the simplified SFC.
