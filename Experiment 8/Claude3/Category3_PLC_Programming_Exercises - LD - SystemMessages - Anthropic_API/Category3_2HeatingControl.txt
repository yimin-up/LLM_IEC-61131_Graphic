Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program to control a heating system to maintain temperature between 20-22°„C based on 3 temperature sensors:

      PROGRAM HeatingControl
      VAR
        Temp1 : REAL := 0.0;  // Temperature sensor 1 input 
        Temp2 : REAL := 0.0;  // Temperature sensor 2 input
        Temp3 : REAL := 0.0;  // Temperature sensor 3 input
        AvgTemp : REAL := 0.0; // Calculated average temperature  
        HeaterOn : BOOL := FALSE; // Heater control output
      END_VAR

      LD    Temp1
      ADD   Temp2
      ADD   Temp3
      DIV   3.0
      ST    AvgTemp

      LD    AvgTemp
      LT    20.0
      OR(
      LD    HeaterOn
      AND
      LD    AvgTemp
      LT    22.0
      )
      ST    HeaterOn

      END_PROGRAM

Explanation:
1. The first rung calculates the average of the 3 temperature sensor inputs and stores it in AvgTemp variable.  

2. The second rung controls the heater:
   - If AvgTemp < 20, turn heater on
   - If heater is already on, keep it on until AvgTemp >= 22
   - Otherwise turn heater off

3. HeaterOn is the Boolean output that controls turning the heater on or off.

This implements a simple thermostat control with 2 degree hysteresis to maintain the average measured temperature between 20-22°„C. Let me know if you have any other questions!
