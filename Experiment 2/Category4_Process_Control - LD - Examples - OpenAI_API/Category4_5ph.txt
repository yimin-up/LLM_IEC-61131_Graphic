Implementing a PID feedback control for pH in a purely Ladder Diagram format and adhering strictly to an ASCII representation has its limitations in detailing complex arithmetic and function implementation. However, I'll outline a simplified approach to demonstrate how one might structure the logic for initiating PID control on a pH level within the constraints mentioned.

In real-world applications, a PID control function would typically be encapsulated within a dedicated function block. However, given the request, let's lay out an essential structure using relay logic symbols in ASCII, focusing on reading the pH sensor, comparing it to a setpoint, and adjusting an output accordingly. For precise PID calculations (Proportional, Integral, Derivative), a PLC with PID function blocks or instructions is highly recommended as they are optimized for such tasks.

Note: PID control involves calculations that can't be directly represented in ASCII Ladder Diagram art. This example abstracts the PID process into simplistic control logic for illustrative purposes.

*Error Calculation*: This hypothetical step compares the setpoint to the actual pH reading to determine the error, which is then used in the PID calculation.

*PID Calculations*: This step symbolizes the PID control action where the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative components are computed based on the error. This segment cannot be accurately detailed in Ladder logic without a specific PID instruction or function block, as actual mathematical operations exceed the representation capabilities of ASCII Ladder Diagrams.

*Adjust Valve/Actuator*: This step represents the act of adjusting a valve or other actuators based on the PID calculations to maintain the desired pH level.

For implementation:
- Ensure your PLC supports PID functions.
- Use dedicated PID function blocks or instructions that are part of your PLC's software.
- Configure the PID block with the necessary parameters, including setpoints, feedback input (pH sensor signal), and output (valve or actuator control).

This simplified diagram is meant to evoke the conceptual approach rather than serve as a direct implementation guide for PID control, which, due to its complexity and precision requirements, is best managed with the appropriate software tools and function blocks provided by your PLC programming environment.
