To achieve a complete answer for the given tasks, each component will be broken down step by step according to the required format.

### Controlled Shutdown of a Steel Production Facility
#### Step 1:####
Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Sequential Function Chart for the controlled shut-down process.

Inputs:
- **ShutdownInitiate**: Boolean signal to start the shutdown procedure.
- **FuelGasFlowRate**: Real-time measurement of the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace.
- **OxygenSupplyRate**: Real-time measurement of the oxygen supply rate to the burners.
- **CurrentTime**: System clock for measuring intervals.

Outputs:
- **ControlGasFlowSetpoint**: Setpoint for the fuel gas flow rate.
- **ControlOxygenSupplySetpoint**: Setpoint for the oxygen supply rate.

#### Step 2:####
Briefly describe the state machine of the shutdown requirements.

1. **StartShutdown**: The process begins when the ShutdownInitiate signal is received.
2. **ReduceFuelGasFlow**: Gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over 12 hours.
3. **AdjustOxygenSupply**: Simultaneously adjust the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5.
4. **CompleteShutdown**: End the procedure when the fuel gas flow rate reaches its minimum or after 12 hours.

#### Step 3:####
Give the Sequential Function Chart program in ASCII art.

```

#### Step 4:####
Explain the purpose of each step, action, and transition.

1. **StartShutdown**: Waits for the initiation signal for the shutdown.
2. **ReduceFuelGasFlow**: Gradually reduces the gas flow setpoint by a specific decrement (delta) value. This action repeats every cycle until the total time of 12 hours is reached.
3. **Transition from ReduceFuelGasFlow**: Checks if 12 hours have passed. If not, continues to reduce the fuel gas flow.
4. **AdjustOxygenSupply**: Adjusts the oxygen supply to maintain the specified fuel-to-air ratio, based on the current gas flow rate setpoint.
5. **Transition from AdjustOxygenSupply**: Verifies that the fuel gas flow rate is above a minimum threshold. If below, proceeds to complete the shutdown.
6. **CompleteShutdown**: Marks the end of the shutdown process once all conditions have been met.

#### Step 5:####
Check the SFC you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

- **StartShutdown** should ensure it only triggers once upon receiving the ShutdownInitiate signal.
- **ReduceFuelGasFlow** must decrement the fuel gas setpoint appropriately, ensuring it does not exceed the limits of the system.
- **AdjustOxygenSupply** must continuously adjust the oxygen setpoint based on the changing gas flow setpoint, adhering to the specified ratio.
- **CompleteShutdown** ensures the system safely shuts down by confirming all required conditions are met.
- The transitions must be accurately evaluated at each step to ensure the correct movement through the sequence.
- Timers and counters used should adhere to the specified durations and increments.
  
This provides a high-level overview of implementing a controlled shutdown of a steel production facility using the IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart, matching the given requirements with considerations for safety and efficiency.
