> Write a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program, not a function block, to implement a feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-based predicted load.

# GPT4

Creating a Ladder Diagram in textual form involves simulating the graphical elements (like contacts, coils, and connections) of ladder logic using ASCII art. For a feedforward control system to adjust the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-predicted load, we need to consider a simplified scenario.

Let's assume we have a load sensor that outputs a signal proportional to the predicted load. This signal can be represented as a variable (for instance, `PredictedLoad`) within a PLC program. The program should adjust the speed of the conveyor belt represented by another variable, say `ConveyorSpeed`.

Given these variables, we'll simulate a scenario where the `ConveyorSpeed` is adjusted based on the `PredictedLoad`. For the sake of simplicity, this ASCII art Ladder Diagram will not detail signal acquisition or specific speed control mechanisms but rather focus on the logical relationship between the predicted load and the conveyor speed.

Here is how an ASCII art version of this control logic might look:

```
             +----[/]----+    +----( )----+
             |           |    |           |
 [Start]-----+           |--[>|PredLoadLm]|-----[Stop]
             |           |    |           |
             +----( )----+    +----[/]----+
                Reset          ConveyorSpeedAdj
```

Explanation:
- `[Start]` and `[Stop]` represent push buttons or digital inputs to start and stop the process, respectively.
- `[/]` represents Normally Open (NO) contacts in Ladder Logic.
- `( )` represents coils or outputs.
- `PredLoadLm`: This would represent a block of logic (e.g., a comparator or threshold function) that determines whether the `PredictedLoad` exceeds a certain limit. If the load surpasses a specified threshold, it activates the `ConveyorSpeedAdj` coil to adjust the conveyor speed.
- `ConveyorSpeedAdj`: This coil represents the action of adjusting the conveyor's speed based on the `PredLoadLm` logic. This could involve increasing speed, decreasing speed, or engaging a different speed profile, depending on the actual system design.
- `Reset` is a logic to reset the system or process.

Note: In an actual IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram, symbols like contacts and coils are visually represented and the programming software allows for direct manipulation of these elements. Moreover, the actions like adjusting the speed would be defined in detail, possibly involving PID control or direct mapping from load to speed settings. This illustrative example simplifies those mechanisms for the sake of explanation and representation in ASCII art.
