Designing a complete batch control process for a polyethylene production line in a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram format, focusing on the specified steps: raw material preparation, polymerization, quenching, drying, pelletizing, quality control, as well as packaging and storage. For the sake of clarity and simplicity, we will abstract the process logic for each step and represent them in a sequence of operations.

Given the complexity of such a process, it's important to note that in real industrial applications, these diagrams can be quite detailed, incorporating various sensors, actuators, and complex logic including timing, counting, and conditional settings. The example provided here will highlight the sequence control part of the process. It will be simplified for readability and understanding.

This ASCII art ladder diagram presents a high-level view of the sequence that a batch control system for polyethylene production might follow. Actual control logic, interlocks, and transition conditions between steps are abstracted for simplicity. Each step in the process needs its own detailed control logic, including safety checks, timers for process timing, and feedback loops for process conditions (temperature, pressure, material flow, etc.). Additionally, the "Status Flags" signify process completion flags that would be set by various sensors and condition checks throughout the process.
