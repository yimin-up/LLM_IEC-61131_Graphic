Below is a conceptual Ladder Diagram (LD) representation of a PID feedback control for regulating the temperature inside a gas turbine through controlling the opening of an inlet valve based on a set temperature setpoint. This model assumes the availability of a PID block compliant with IEC 61131-3 standards, a current temperature measurement input, and an output signal to the inlet valve.

### Key Components:
- **Setpoint (SP)**: This is the desired temperature inside the gas turbine, which you want to maintain. It is an input to the PID block.

- **Process Variable (PV)**: This represents the current temperature inside the gas turbine. It's the feedback to the PID controller indicating the system's present state.

- **Output (OUT)**: The signal generated by the PID block to adjust the inlet valve's position. The intention is to control the amount of airflow (or gas) into the turbine, indirectly controlling the temperature.

- **InletValveCmd**: This is the actuator (in this case, an inlet valve) which is controlled based on the PID output. Adjusting this valve helps in maintaining the desired setpoint temperature.

- **KP, KI, KD**: These are the PID coefficients for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms, respectively. They need to be tuned based on the system's dynamics to achieve a stable control process with minimal overshoot and steady-state error.

This LD program provides a skeletal structure. Specific implementations might require additional functionalities such as safety interlocks, alarm management for detecting sensor failures or out-of-range temperatures, and manual override capabilities. Also, the PID block configuration, including tuning the KP, KI, and KD parameters, depends highly on the specific turbine model, its response characteristics, and the operating conditions.
