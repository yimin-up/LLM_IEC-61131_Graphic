To create a self-contained Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for a feedforward control system designed to adjust the speed of a conveyor belt based on the sensor-based predicted load, we'll break down the control logic into steps and transitions. Since an ASCII-based representation is needed, I will lay out the steps (actions) and transitions (conditions) in a simplified and illustrative manner without specific syntax. In actual implementation, this conceptual design would be further elaborated into specific IEC 61131-3 compatible code using a development environment.

### Conveyor Belt Speed Adjustment Control System - SFC Design

**Legend:**
- S# = Step (followed by a number)
- T# = Transition (followed by a number)
- ---> = Direction of progression
- Conditions/Actions are in brackets []

**SFC Program Structure:**

```
    (Start System)
         |
        S1 [Initialize System: Reset speed; Clear errors]
         |
        T1 [System Initialized]
         |
        ---> S2 [Read Sensors: Predict load]
         |
        T2 [Load Predicted]
         |
        ---> S3 [Calculate Speed Adjustment]
             [Action: Use the predicted load to calculate required speed adjustment]
         |
        T3 [Speed Adjustment Calculated]
         |
        ---> S4 [Adjust Conveyor Speed]
             [Action: Apply calculated speed adjustment to conveyor belt]
         |
        T4 [Speed Adjusted OR Error]
         |
        /            \
      /              \
     /                \
T5 [Error]        T6 [No Error]
     |                |
     |                ---> S5 [Monitor System]
     |                      [Action: Continuously monitor system parameters]
     |                      [and predicted load for further adjustments]
     |                     
     ---> S6 [Handle Error]
            [Action: Log error; Attempt to auto-correct if possible; Notify operator]

```

**End of SFC Program Structure**

### Explanation:

- **S1 Initialize System:** Sets up the system by resetting speed settings to default and clearing any pre-existing errors. 
- **T1 System Initialized:** Checks if the system is properly initialized.
- **S2 Read Sensors:** Measures and predicts the current load on the conveyor belt using sensors.
- **T2 Load Predicted:** Confirms that the load has been predicted.
- **S3 Calculate Speed Adjustment:** Based on the predicted load, calculates how much the conveyor belt's speed should be adjusted.
- **T3 Speed Adjustment Calculated:** Verifies the calculation is done.
- **S4 Adjust Conveyor Speed:** Adjusts the speed of the conveyor belt as calculated.
- **T4 Speed Adjusted OR Error:** Checks if the speed has been successfully adjusted or if there was an error.
- **S5 Monitor System:** Continuously monitors the system to ensure it operates correctly and adjusts as necessary based on the sensor's load prediction.
- **T5 Error / T6 No Error:** Transition T5 leads to error handling if an error occurred during operation. Transition T6 confirms operation without errors.
- **S6 Handle Error:** Logs the error, attempts an auto-correction if possible, and notifies the operator.

This SFC diagram outlines the logical flow for a feedforward control system for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on the predicted load. Each step would be elaborated with specific IEC 61131-3 code for actions and conditions in a real-world PLC programming environment.
