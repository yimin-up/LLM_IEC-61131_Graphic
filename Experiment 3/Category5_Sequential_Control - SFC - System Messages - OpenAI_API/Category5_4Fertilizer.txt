Given the constraint of representing an IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in ASCII, I'll create a simplified version focused on the reaction stage of urea fertilizer production, as per ISA-88 batch control recipe guidelines. The core stages - heating, cooling, and pressure regulation - will be emphasized.

### Urea Fertilizer Production - Reaction Stage Control

#### Key Parameters:
- **Heating:** Ramp to 180°„C.
- **Pressure:** Maintain at 140 bar.
- **Cooling:** Lower to 40°„C after reaction.

### Description of Steps

1. **Heating:** Heat the mixture to 180°„C. Transition `[HT_OK]` checks if the desired temperature is achieved.
   
2. **Pressure Regulation:** During the reaction, pressure is regulated and maintained at 140 bar. Transition `[PS_OK]` confirms pressure is stable.
   
3. **Reaction:** The chemical reaction takes place under the set conditions. Transition `[DONE]` signifies the completion of the reaction phase.
   
4. **Cooling:** Post-reaction, the mixture is cooled down to 40°„C for safe handling or further processing. Transition `[CL_OK]` ensures cooling is complete.

5. **End:** Marks the completion of the reaction stage of urea fertilizer production.

### Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) Actions:
Each step will involve activating specific outputs to control heaters, pressure valves, and cooling systems. PLC logic will monitor temperatures and pressure through sensor inputs, executing these steps sequentially to maintain the desired process conditions.

### Note:
This simplified ASCII SFC chart represents a high-level overview. In practice, detailed programming will involve specifying actions (`Action Qualifiers`), conditions for transitions, and integrating safety interlocks. Implementing such a process control system would also require adherence to safety and environmental standards applicable to chemical processing industries.

Remember that actual PLC programming for industrial processes like urea production is complex and requires rigorous testing, validation, and compliance with industry standards and safety regulations. This example provides a conceptual view for educational purposes.
