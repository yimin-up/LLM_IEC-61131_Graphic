Given the task to write a Ladder Diagram (LD) program for implementing PID feedback pH control, let's go through the required steps. First, understand that PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control involves continuous adjustment of a process based on feedback from measuring a specific parameter - in this case, the pH level. This task implicates a system where inputs will typically include sensors¡¯ data (e.g., pH level), and outputs will include actuators' actions (e.g., adjusting a valve to add a chemical to maintain desired pH level).

### Step 1:####
Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Ladder Diagram, and the standard symbols they use.

Inputs:
1. pH_Sensor: Analog input that measures pH level. (I: Input)
2. Start_Stop: Digital input to start or stop the PID control. (I: Input)

Outputs:
1. Valve_Control: Analog output to control a valve for adjusting pH level. (Q: Output)

### Step 2:####
Give the Ladder Diagram program.

Due to the constraints of text representation, the LD program will be simplified to fundamental logic for PID initiation and control signal adjustment based on concept. A real-world PID control implementation would require more complexity and computations typically handled more efficiently in Function Block Diagram (FBD) or Structured Text (ST) for the PID algorithm part.

```
+----[ ]----[/]----( )----+
| Start_Stop |  Valve_Control|
+--------------------------+
```

This simplistic representation implies:
- Start_Stop input engages or disengages the PID control loop.
- The actual PID algorithm's computation and signal to Valve_Control aren't detailed, assuming theoretical real-time adjustment within the system's capabilities.

### Step 3:####
Give the logical expressions for each rung.

Rung 1: Valve_Control = Start_Stop AND PID_Algorithm(pH_Sensor)

Note: PID_Algorithm(pH_Sensor) represents a simplified placeholder for the actual PID computation based on the pH_Sensor input.

### Step 4:####
Briefly describe the state machine of the Ladder Diagram.

The state machine for this LD-based PID control can be simplified into two states based on the Start_Stop input:
1. **Inactive State**: When Start_Stop is not engaged, the Valve_Control remains inactive, and no adjustment for pH control is made.
2. **Active State**: When Start_Stop is engaged, the system enters the active state, where the PID_Algorithm continuously computes the required adjustments based on pH_Sensor feedback, and actively controls the Valve_Control to maintain the desired pH level.

### Step 5:####
Check the LD you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

According to IEC 61131-3 standard:
- The use of inputs (I) and outputs (Q) is correctly designated.
- The simplification of PID logic into a placeholder for conceptual illustration aligns with the intent of explaining the control loop, though actual implementation requires detailed computational logic, possibly involving additional function blocks or algorithmic scripts in Structured Text not represented in this simplified LD example.
- The diagram correctly starts with inputs and ends with outputs, adhering to the flow from left to right as per the standard's guidelines.
- Due to the conceptual nature of the example, actual PID computation, error handling, and detailed control mechanisms (e.g., limits, alarms) are not depicted but are crucial for a real-world application.

This response outlines a conceptual framework for a PID-based control system in Ladder Diagram format according to IEC 61131-3 standard while acknowledging the limitations and simplifications made for illustrative purposes.
