**Explanation:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   `CarSensor`: Detects if a car is present in the washing station.
    *   `HumanSensor`: Detects if a human is present in the washing area.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   `StartWashing`: Activates the car wash process (e.g., turns on water, soap dispenser, brushes).
    *   `Alarm`: Triggers an alarm if a human is detected while the car wash is running.
*   **Logic:**
    *   The `StartWashing` output is activated only when both conditions are met:
        *   `CarSensor` is ON (car is present).
        *   `HumanSensor.NOT` is ON (meaning no human is detected, as we use the negated signal).
    *   If `StartWashing` is active and the `HumanSensor` detects a human presence, the `Alarm` output is activated.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Safety Measures:** This is a basic example.  Real-world car wash systems require additional safety measures and sensors to ensure safe operation.
*   **Timer for Washing Cycle:** A timer can be added to control the duration of the car wash cycle.
*   **Multiple Stages:** The washing process can be divided into multiple stages (e.g., pre-wash, soap, rinse, wax) with separate control logic for each stage. 
*   **User Interface:** Implement a user interface (e.g., HMI panel) to display status, control settings, and handle alarms.
