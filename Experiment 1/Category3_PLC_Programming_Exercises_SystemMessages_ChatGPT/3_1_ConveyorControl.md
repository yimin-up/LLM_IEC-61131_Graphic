Your task is to write IEC 61131-3 Structured Text programs according to the requirements delimited by triple quotes.
'''
Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to control a conveyor belt system with three stations, which each allow as user to stop the conveyor. The system should automatically start and stop based on five sensors that detect the presence of objects on the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt speed shall be maintained at 2 meters per second.

To create a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for controlling a conveyor belt system with your specified requirements, we need to consider several key elements:

Sensors: There are five sensors for object detection on the conveyor belt. These sensors will be boolean inputs to the PLC program.
Stations: Three user-operable stations to stop the conveyor belt. These could be implemented as boolean inputs as well.
Conveyor Belt Control: To control the conveyor belt, including starting, stopping, and maintaining a speed of 2 meters per second.
Automatic Start/Stop Logic: Based on the sensor inputs, the conveyor should start or stop automatically.
Given these requirements, the following is an example of how the Structured Text program might look:

```iec
PROGRAM ConveyorBeltControl
    VAR
        Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5: BOOL; // Object detection sensors
        Station1, Station2, Station3: BOOL; // User-operable stations
        ConveyorRunning: BOOL; // Conveyor belt running status
        ConveyorSpeed: REAL := 2.0; // Conveyor speed in meters per second
    END_VAR

    // Main control logic
    IF (Sensor1 OR Sensor2 OR Sensor3 OR Sensor4 OR Sensor5) AND NOT (Station1 OR Station2 OR Station3) THEN
        ConveyorRunning := TRUE;
    ELSE
        ConveyorRunning := FALSE;
    END_IF

    // Speed control (assuming an external function or method to control speed)
    IF ConveyorRunning THEN
        ControlConveyorSpeed(ConveyorSpeed);
    ELSE
        ControlConveyorSpeed(0.0); // Stop the conveyor
    END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```
Key Points:

Sensor1 to Sensor5 represent the five sensors. When any sensor detects an object (i.e., is TRUE), the conveyor should run unless stopped by a station.
Station1 to Station3 represent the user-operable stations. If any station is activated (i.e., is TRUE), the conveyor should stop.
ConveyorRunning is a boolean flag to represent whether the conveyor belt is currently running.
ConveyorSpeed is set to 2.0 meters per second as per your requirement. This assumes there's an external function or method (ControlConveyorSpeed) to actually control the speed of the conveyor. The actual implementation of this function would depend on the specific hardware and software environment.
Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, additional considerations such as safety interlocks, emergency stops, and more sophisticated control logic may be necessary. The actual implementation would also need to consider the specific PLC hardware and its capabilities.
