Creating a simple ISA-88 control recipe for the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) encapsulated within an IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC) requires breaking down the processing stages and operations into manageable function blocks and steps according to the specific requirements listed.

Given the recipe stages (Polymerize, Decover, Dry) and specified operations, here's a rudimentary outline for the SFC program:

Within this SFC structure, each process operation would be detailed as follows:

### Prepare Reactor
- **Operation**: Use a vacuum pump to evacuate the reactor, ensuring all oxygen is removed.
- **Parameters**: Achieve a vacuum of <50 mbar.
- **Timing**: This operation might take a predetermined time to achieve the required vacuum level, e.g., 10 minutes.

### Charge
- **Operation**: Sequentially add demineralized water, followed by surfactants into the reactor under controlled conditions.
- **Parameters**: Specific volumes based on batch size, e.g., 1000 L water and 100 kg surfactants.
- **Timing**: Water addition - 5 minutes, surfactants - 2 minutes.

### React
- **Operation**: Add vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst to the reactor. Heat the mixture to 55 - 60¡ãC and maintain until a decrease in reactor pressure indicates the reaction's progression.
- **Parameters**: Monomer and catalyst volumes proportional to batch size, temperature range: 55 - 60¡ãC, monitor pressure drop to determine reaction completion.
- **Timing**: Heating to reaction temperature - 15 minutes, reaction hold time varies by batch and is monitored by pressure.

### Decover
- In this stage, any unreacted monomer is removed. Without specific instructions, one might assume this involves venting under controlled conditions or using a vacuum system.

### Dry
- The final stage dries the PVC to achieve the desired product dryness. Specifications may involve heating under reduced pressure.

**Note**: This SFC overview is a framework. Actual PLC programming requires translating these process steps into executable code blocks (e.g., Structured Text, Ladder Diagram), incorporating sensors, actuators (valves, pumps, heaters), and safety interlocks. Process parameters (temperatures, pressures, volumes) would need to be precisely defined per the specific production requirements and equipment capabilities. Safety checks, especially for reactions involving vinyl chloride (a hazardous material), must be designed according to industry standards and local regulations.
