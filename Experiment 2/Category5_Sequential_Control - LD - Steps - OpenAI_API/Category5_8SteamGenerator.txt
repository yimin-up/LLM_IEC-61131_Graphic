Given the complexity and high-level functionality of a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the significant mathematical and algorithmic computations involved, it is important to note that implementing such a control strategy directly in Ladder Diagram (LD) is both unconventional and highly impractical. Typically, NMPC is executed within more powerful, general-purpose computing environments due to its computational intensity and need for handling complex algorithms not suited to the graphical nature and execution model of Ladder Logic, which is primarily designed for simpler, sequential control tasks and logic operations.

However, for the sake of aligning with the query and providing a structured approach to an otherwise impractical scenario, we can outline a hypothetical representation focusing on the inputs and outputs relevant to a steam generator startup process, simplified control logic that could feasibly be represented in a Ladder Diagram, and consider how various elements could be conceptually tied to an NMPC scheme without fully capturing the NMPC's complexity.

### Step 1:####
Inputs:
- T_steam: Temperature of the steam (Analog Input)
- P_steam: Pressure of the steam (Analog Input)
- W_water: Water level in the boiler (Analog Input)

Outputs:
- V_valve: Control signal to the feedwater valve (Analog Output)
- B_burner: Burner operation signal (Digital Output)

Standard symbols:
- |- (I): Contact (representing an input)
- ( ) : Coil (representing an output)
- ---: Wires/Connections

### Step 2:####
Given the task's complexity, traditional Ladder Diagram for NMPC cannot be practically illustrated. Instead, a simplified version focusing on controlling the startup phase based on steam pressure and water level might look like this in ASCII art:

```
                            +------( ) B_burner
                            |
|- T_steam_high-------------+
|
|- W_water_low --+--( ) V_valve
                 |
|- P_steam_low --+
```

### Step 3:####
Logical expressions for each rung:
1. Burner Operation: If Steam Temperature is High, Activate the Burner
   - `T_steam_high -> B_burner`
2. Feedwater Valve Control: If Water Level is Low OR Steam Pressure is Low, Open the Feedwater Valve
   - `W_water_low OR P_steam_low -> V_valve`

### Step 4:####
Briefly, the state machine implied here would operate as follows:
- **State 1**: Monitoring - The system continuously monitors steam temperature, steam pressure, and water level.
- **State 2**: Feedwater Adjustment - If the water level is detected to be low or the steam pressure is low, the control system opens the feedwater valve (activating `V_valve`) to adjust the water level and pressure as necessary.
- **State 3**: Burner Operation - Concurrently, if the steam temperature is high, indicating a need for the burner to operate to heat the water, the burner is activated (`B_burner`).

### Step 5:####
Check according to IEC 61131 standard:
- This hypothetical ladder diagram adheres to basic IEC 61131-3 constructs with the use of contacts and coils for representing inputs and outputs.
- It simplifies the representation of control actions (feedwater valve control and burner operation) based on the monitored conditions (steam temperature, steam pressure, and water level).
- Given the original request for an NMPC implementation, it is crucial to acknowledge that actual NMPC functionalities¡ªoptimizing startup procedures through predictive modeling and control¡ªwould typically be executed outside of the Ladder Logic environment, possibly through integration with advanced computational modules or external software capable of handling the required complex calculations.
