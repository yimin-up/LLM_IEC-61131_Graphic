Implementing a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram for a feedforward control system to adjust conveyor belt speed based on sensor predictions involves accepting input from the load sensor and translating that to speed adjustments for the conveyor belt motor. Below is a conceptual ASCII art ladder diagram representation, assuming a simplified scenario where the sensor output is directly proportionate to the desired speed adjustment:

### Explanation:

- **LoadSensor**: Represents the analog input from a sensor predicting the load on the conveyor belt. This might be an actual sensor value or an interpreted value from a PLC analog input module.

- **SpeedAdjust**: Stands for an analog output that controls the speed of the conveyor belt. This output sends a signal to a variable frequency drive (VFD) or a motor controller adjusting the conveyor speed.

- **LOAD_TO_SPEED**: A conceptual function (not a standard ladder logic element, but representative of the logic that needs to be applied) that maps or scales the sensor input to a suitable speed adjustment value. This could be implemented through a series of ladder logic comparisons and output assignments or by using an actual function block if the PLC supports it.

- **ConveyorSpeedSetpoint**: This would represent a setpoint or a base speed for the conveyor. The "SpeedAdjust" is either added to or used to modify this base setpoint to react to the anticipated load.

- **Reset**: A control bit or input that, when activated, can reset any overrides or special conditions back to a default state, such as setting the conveyor to a predefined speed or stopping it.

- **ManualSpeedOverride**: A manual control, possibly from a switch or HMI (Human-Machine Interface), to override the automatic speed adjustments for testing, maintenance, or emergency purposes.

This diagram is a high-level abstraction. The actual implementation would require incorporating the specific I/O addressing, scaling the analog inputs and outputs, and possibly dealing with additional factors like maximum and minimum speed limits, acceleration and deceleration ramps, and safety interlocks.
