Creating a startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine involves multiple steps that focus on safety, equipment readiness, and process optimization. Each step detailed here is aligned with the required equipment readiness for a press section, considering typical parameter values like pressures, speeds, and temperatures, which may vary based on the specific model and configuration of the Valmet paper machine. 

Since it's impractical to include exact numerical parameter values without knowing the specific model of the Valmet press section, generic placeholders will be used. It's vital to consult the machine's manual for precise values.

### Startup Sequence Overview:

1. **Safety Checks:** Verify that all emergency stops are reset and safety guards are in place.
2. **Equipment Pre-Check:** Ensure all press section components are in operational condition.
3. **Hydraulic System Preparation:** Prime and pressurize the hydraulic systems used for press rolls.
4. **Moisture Control:** Start the moisture control system to maintain paper moisture at desired levels.
5. **Temperature Control:** Initialize the temperature control systems for heated rolls, if applicable.
6. **Speed Alignment:** Align the press section speed with the forming section to ensure consistent paper quality.
7. **Engage Press Rolls:** Gradually engage the press rolls to the running position.
8. **Process Monitoring:** Begin process monitoring and adjustments based on paper quality and machine performance.

### IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart:

In this ASCII art representation of an SFC, steps are broadly indicative of the processes and checks required rather than specific operational commands. Specific programming languages under IEC 61131-3, such as Structured Text (ST), Ladder Diagram (LD), or Function Block Diagram (FBD), can be used to detail each action within this framework.

In an actual implementation, each of these blocks would contain PLC code (ST, LD, FBD, etc.) detailing specific checks (like sensor readings), actions (motor starts, valve position changes), and conditions (if-then logic, loops) to fully control the startup of the press section in compliance with IEC 61131-3 standards. The use of placeholder activities should be replaced with machine-specific commands and routines, including safety interlocks and process variable checks, to ensure a smooth and safe startup process.
