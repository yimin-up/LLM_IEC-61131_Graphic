Designing a self-contained ladder diagram for a traffic light system involving cars and pedestrian controls, along with emergency vehicle priority, requires several key components: timers for light changes, inputs for pedestrian buttons, and sensors for emergency vehicles. The system logic should ensure that normal traffic light sequences are interrupted for emergency vehicle priority.

Given the complexity of such a system, this ASCII representation simplifies the design into a conceptual overview:

Key Components & Their Functions:

- **EMERGENCY:** Input signal indicating the presence of an emergency vehicle. This signal has the highest priority and will trigger a sequence that provides immediate access through the intersection.
- **TIMER1** and **TIMER2:** Timers control the duration of green, yellow, and red lights for both vehicles and pedestrians. TIMER1 might control main traffic lights, while TIMER2 could handle pedestrian wait times.
- **GREEN, YELLOW, RED:** Outputs to control the corresponding traffic light signals.
- **PEDESTRIAN BUTTON:** Input from a button pressed by pedestrians wishing to cross. This input impacts the timing by introducing a pedestrian crossing phase.
- **RESET_TIMER1**, **RESET_TIMER2:** Logic to reset the timers based on specific conditions, ensuring that the system can return to its standard cycle after an emergency situation or pedestrian crossing phase.

This diagram is a simplified representation. The detailed programming would include configuring the timers with appropriate durations for each signal phase, implementing safety interlocks to prevent conflicting signals, and ensuring overall system reliability.
