To create an automatic car wash station program that adheres to these specifications, I'll design the ladder logic with the following components:

- **CarDetectedSensor:** This is a sensor input to detect whether a car is present in the car wash station.
- **HumanDetectedSensor:** This sensor checks for the presence of humans in the car wash area.
- **StartWash:** This is a control output that starts the car wash process.
- **Alarm:** This is an output that activates when a human is detected in the car wash area during operation.

Here is a simple representation of the ladder diagram in ASCII art to fulfill the requirements:

|   CarDetectedSensor         NOT HumanDetectedSensor  StartWash|
+-------| |--------------------------------------| |------( )----+
|                                                               |
|                       HumanDetectedSensor       Alarm         |
+-------------------------------| |----------------------( )----+
|                                                               |

```

Explanation of the Logic:

1. **Car Presence and No Human Detected:** The first rung checks if a car is detected (`CarDetectedSensor` is true) and no human is present (`NOT HumanDetectedSensor` is true). If both conditions are met, the `StartWash` output is activated to commence the wash process.

2. **Human Presence Detection:** The second rung checks if a human is detected (`HumanDetectedSensor` is true) in the car wash area. If so, it activates the `Alarm` to alert and ensure safety measures, halting the wash process if it was active. 

This simple program meets the provided requirements using the safety and operational standards outlined for PLC programs, particularly focusing on prioritizing human safety in automated operations.
