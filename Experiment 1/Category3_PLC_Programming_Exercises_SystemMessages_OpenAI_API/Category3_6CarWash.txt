To create a PLC program for an automatic car wash station as specified, we need to consider the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
- CarPresentSensor: A sensor that detects if a car is present in the car wash station.
- HumanPresentSensor: A sensor that detects if a human is present in the car wash area.

Outputs:
- StartCarWash: A control signal to start the car wash process.
- SendAlarm: A control signal to activate an alarm when a human is detected in the wash area.

The program logic will work as follows:
1. The car wash process should only start if a car is detected (CarPresentSensor = TRUE) and no human is present (HumanPresentSensor = FALSE).
2. If a human is detected in the area at any time (HumanPresentSensor = TRUE), the car wash process should stop immediately, and an alarm should be sent.

Below is the Structured Text (ST) program according to IEC 61131-3 standard:

```pascal
PROGRAM AutoCarWashStation
VAR
    CarPresentSensor : BOOL; // TRUE if car is present, FALSE otherwise
    HumanPresentSensor : BOOL; // TRUE if human is detected, FALSE otherwise
    StartCarWash : BOOL; // Control signal to start/stop the car wash
    SendAlarm : BOOL; // Control signal for the alarm
END_VAR

BEGIN
    IF (CarPresentSensor = TRUE) AND (HumanPresentSensor = FALSE) THEN
        // Start car wash if car is present and no human is detected
        StartCarWash := TRUE;
        SendAlarm := FALSE; // Ensure alarm is not active
    ELSIF (HumanPresentSensor = TRUE) THEN
        // Stop car wash and send alarm if human is detected
        StartCarWash := FALSE;
        SendAlarm := TRUE;
    ELSE
        // Ensure everything is stopped and reset if no car is present
        StartCarWash := FALSE;
        SendAlarm := FALSE;
    END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

This program checks the status of CarPresentSensor and HumanPresentSensor to control the car wash process. The washing starts only when a car is present without any human in the area, ensuring safety. When a human is detected, the process stops immediately and an alarm signal is activated to alert the necessary personnel.
