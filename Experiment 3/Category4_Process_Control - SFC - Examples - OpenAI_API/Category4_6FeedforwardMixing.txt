Creating a fully self-contained Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program within the constraints of textual representation to implement feedforward control for a mixing process of two reactants involves specifying stages for the different steps in the process, including dosing reactants, mixing, and processing the outcome. The IEC 61131-3 standard includes several programming languages, one of which is SFC, specifically designed for depicting the sequence of operations.

In real-world applications, this SFC would be designed using dedicated software, and the details¡ªvariables, conditions, and actions¡ªwould be implemented using other IEC 61131-3 languages like Structured Text (ST), Ladder Diagram (LD), or Function Block Diagram (FBD) within the SFC steps or transitions. Here, we provide a textual representation with an outline that assumes some functions or procedures (for dosing, mixing, etc.) are already defined elsewhere in the control program.

Note: This representation aims to conceptually illustrate how the process might be structured in an SFC.

In this simplified chart:
1. **StartMixProcess**: The initial step where the process waits for a start command.
2. **DoseReactantA/B**: Steps where the system doses each reactant. It is assumed a dosing function controls the amount and timing.
3. **CheckA**: A decision step to verify if dosing of Reactant A has encountered any issues.
4. **ProcessError**: Handles any errors in the process, such as issues in dosing.
5. **MixReactants**: The step where the previously dosed reactants are mixed. This might involve activation of mixers for a defined period.
6. **ProcessOutcome**: Processes the mixed reactants for desired outcomes, possibly involving reactions, heating, etc.
7. **EndOfProcess**: Marks the completion of the mixing and processing cycle.

Transitions between steps are defined by conditions in square brackets. These conditions would be evaluated based on process logic implemented in the control program, e.g., sensor inputs, timers, or logical conditions.

This example is a high-level representation; actual implementation would require defining the control logic (conditions, actions), the hardware configuration (sensors, actuators), and safety considerations pertinent to the process and environment.
