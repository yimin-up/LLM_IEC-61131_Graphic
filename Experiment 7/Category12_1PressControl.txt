This diagram converts the SFC actions and transitions into corresponding Ladder Diagram elements according to IEC 61131-3 standards. The coils `( )` are used to activate the respective actions (MoveDown, MoveUp) based on the evaluation of input conditions (BI for both direction indicator and I for initial condition). The contacts `| |` and `|/|` represent the normally closed and normally open states, respectively. The M+ and M- symbols are used to indicate motor movement directions, adhering to common practices in ladder logic design for motion control.
