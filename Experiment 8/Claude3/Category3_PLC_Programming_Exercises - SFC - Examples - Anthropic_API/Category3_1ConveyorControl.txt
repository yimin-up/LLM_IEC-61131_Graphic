Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 sequential function chart program to control the conveyor belt system as specified:

```
PROGRAM ConveyorControl
VAR
  Sensor1 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Object presence sensor 1 
  Sensor2 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Object presence sensor 2
  Sensor3 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Object presence sensor 3 
  Sensor4 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Object presence sensor 4
  Sensor5 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Object presence sensor 5
  
  StopButton1 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Stop button at station 1
  StopButton2 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Stop button at station 2 
  StopButton3 : BOOL := FALSE;  // Stop button at station 3
  
  ConveyorMotor : REAL := 0.0;  // Conveyor motor speed in m/s
END_VAR

INITIAL_STEP WaitForObject:
  ConveyorMotor := 0.0;  // Conveyor stopped
  
  IF Sensor1 OR Sensor2 OR Sensor3 OR Sensor4 OR Sensor5 THEN
    GOTO StartConveyor;
  END_IF;
END_STEP

STEP StartConveyor:
  ConveyorMotor := 2.0;  // Start conveyor at 2 m/s
  
  IF NOT (Sensor1 OR Sensor2 OR Sensor3 OR Sensor4 OR Sensor5) THEN  
    GOTO WaitForObject;
  END_IF;
  
  IF StopButton1 OR StopButton2 OR StopButton3 THEN
    GOTO StopConveyor; 
  END_IF;
END_STEP

STEP StopConveyor:
  ConveyorMotor := 0.0;  // Stop the conveyor
  
  IF NOT (StopButton1 OR StopButton2 OR StopButton3) THEN
    GOTO StartConveyor;
  END_IF; 
END_STEP

END_PROGRAM
```

This SFC program defines the control logic as follows:

1. It starts in the initial step `WaitForObject` with the conveyor motor stopped. 
2. When any of the 5 object sensors become TRUE, it transitions to the `StartConveyor` step.
3. In `StartConveyor`, the conveyor motor is set to 2 m/s. It stays in this step as long as any sensor detects an object. If all sensors become FALSE, it goes back to `WaitForObject` and stops the conveyor.
4. If any of the 3 stop buttons are pressed while in `StartConveyor`, it transitions to the `StopConveyor` step which stops the motor. 
5. It remains in `StopConveyor` until all stop buttons are released, then goes back to `StartConveyor` to resume motion.

So in summary, the conveyor automatically starts when an object is sensed, maintains 2 m/s while objects are present, and stops when all objects are clear. The stop buttons allow operators at each station to pause the conveyor as needed.
