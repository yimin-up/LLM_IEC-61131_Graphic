**Explanation:**

*   **STOP Button:** The normally closed (NC) contact of the STOP button is in series with the entire circuit. When pressed, it opens the circuit, stopping all operations.
*   **START Button:** The normally open (NO) contact of the START button activates the process when pressed.
*   **COFFEE & MILK Button and COFFEE ONLY Button:** These buttons determine which valves open based on the desired beverage. The logic for these would require additional rungs and conditions depending on the desired behavior.
*   **Tank Level Sensor:** Two normally closed contacts check if the tank level is below the maximum. If so, the respective COFFEE_VALVE and MILK_VALVE are activated.
*   **Mixer Tank Full:** A normally open contact checks if the tank level is equal to or greater than the maximum (130ml). If true, it triggers the MIXER_TIMER.IN, initiating the timer. 
*   **Mixer Timer:** The MIXER_TIMER.Q output activates the MIXER_MOTOR for 4 seconds and simultaneously closes the COFFEE_VALVE and MILK_VALVE using normally closed contacts. 
*   **Output Valve:** Once the timer finishes (MIXER\_TIMER.Q goes false), the normally closed contact opens, activating the OUTPUT_VALVE to dispense the beverage.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Safety Interlocks:** Additional rungs with NC contacts for each valve could be added to ensure the mixer only starts when all valves are functioning correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement rungs to detect and handle errors like valve malfunctions, tank level sensor failures, and mixer motor issues. This could involve activating alarms or stopping the process.
*   **Cleaning Cycle:** Consider adding a cleaning cycle triggered by a dedicated button or automatically after a specific number of uses.

**Note:** This LD program is a basic representation and may require modifications and additional logic based on the specific functionalities and safety requirements of the coffee machine.
