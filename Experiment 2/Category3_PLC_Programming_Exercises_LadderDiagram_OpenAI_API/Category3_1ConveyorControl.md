> Write a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program, not a function block, to control a conveyor belt system with three stations, which each allow a user to stop the conveyor. The system should automatically start and stop based on five sensors that detect the presence of objects on the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt speed shall be maintained at 2 meters per second.

Creating a Ladder Diagram (LD) program for a conveyor belt system, as described, involves considering the logic for controlling the conveyor based on inputs from stations and sensors. Since actual ladder logic programming doesn't directly allow for specifying conveyor belt speed in meters per second, we would usually achieve speed control through analog output or communication with a variable frequency drive (VFD) controlling the motor speed indirectly. For the purpose of this example, I'll simplify the representation by focusing on start/stop control logic, assuming the speed control is externally managed by appropriate hardware configured to maintain the 2 meters/second as per specification.

Given the conveyor system design requirements, I'll represent three stop stations (StopStation1, StopStation2, StopStation3) and five object detection sensors (Sensor1, Sensor2, Sensor3, Sensor4, Sensor5). The conveyor motor (ConveyorMotor) should start automatically unless a stop condition is active (object detection or stop button pressed), and it should stop if any stop condition is met.

This simplified ASCII art represents the ladder logic program to control the conveyor based on these requirements:

### Explanation:
- Start Condition: The conveyor starts (Motor M) if all sensors (Sensor1-5) detect no objects (the logic here assumes "no object" means sensor input is `1` or `TRUE` when no object is present, which might not be typical for all sensor types but demonstrates the logic needed). Additionally, no stop button at any of the stop stations is pressed (StopStation1-3 is `TRUE` when not pressed, `FALSE` when pressed).
- Stop Condition: The conveyor stops if any sensor detects an object (sensors go to `0` or `FALSE`, indicating an object is present), or any stop station button is pressed (StopStation directly going to `0` or `FALSE`).
- This illustration has simplified how sensors and buttons are read and does not specify how the conveyor motor's 2 meters/second speed is controlled, assuming that's handled by other system components or settings.
- Note: The actual implementation would depend on the specific PLC model and how inputs/outputs are physically mapped and addressed in the software. The speed control aspect, in particular, would typically involve analog output to a VFD based on additional logic not shown here (for example, using PID control logic embedded within the VFD or PLC).
