For this specific task, we will break down the requirements and implement them within the confines of a Ladder Diagram program according to the IEC 61131-3 standard. Let's explore this step by step.

### Step 1:#### Define and list the inputs and outputs of the Ladder Diagram, and the standard symbols they use.

Inputs:
- Start_Process (SP): Initiates the production process.
- Raw_Material_Ready (RMR): Indicates raw materials are ready.
- Polymerization_Complete (PC): Indicates the polymerization step is complete.
- Quenching_Complete (QC): Indicates the quenching step is complete.
- Drying_Complete (DC): Indicates the drying step is complete.
- Pelletizing_Complete (PelC): Indicates the pelletizing step is complete.
- QC_Passed (QCP): Indicates the quality control step is passed.

Outputs:
- Begin_Raw_Material_Preparation (BRMP): Activates raw material preparation.
- Begin_Polymerization (BP): Activates the polymerization step.
- Begin_Quenching (BQ): Activates the quenching step.
- Begin_Drying (BD): Activates the drying step.
- Begin_Pelletizing (BPe): Activates pelletizing.
- Begin_QC (BQC): Activates quality control.
- Package_And_Store (PAS): Activates packaging and storage.

### Step 2:#### Give the Ladder Diagram program.

```
    (SP)----[/]-----------------(BRMP)
    
    (RMR)---[/]-----------------(BP)
    
    (PC)----[/]-----------------(BQ)
    
    (QC)----[/]-----------------(BD)
    
    (DC)----[/]-----------------(BPe)
    
    (PelC)--[/]-----------------(BQC)
    
    (QCP)---[/]-----------------(PAS)
```

### Step 3:#### Give the logical expressions for each rung.

1. Begin_Raw_Material_Preparation = Start_Process AND NOT Begin_Raw_Material_Preparation
2. Begin_Polymerization = Raw_Material_Ready AND NOT Begin_Polymerization
3. Begin_Quenching = Polymerization_Complete AND NOT Begin_Quenching
4. Begin_Drying = Quenching_Complete AND NOT Begin_Drying
5. Begin_Pelletizing = Drying_Complete AND NOT Begin_Pelletizing
6. Begin_QC = Pelletizing_Complete AND NOT Begin_QC
7. Package_And_Store = QC_Passed AND NOT Package_And_Store

### Step 4:#### Briefly describe the state machine of the Ladder Diagram.

The Ladder Diagram represents a sequential control process for polyethylene production, structured as a basic state machine with transitions based on the completion of each step before moving to the next:

1. **Start_Process** activates the **Begin_Raw_Material_Preparation** state.
2. Once raw materials are ready, the process transitions to the **Begin_Polymerization** state.
3. After polymerization, the process moves to **Begin_Quenching**, followed sequentially by **Begin_Drying**, **Begin_Pelletizing**, and **Begin_QC**.
4. If the quality control is passed, the final state **Package_And_Store** is triggered.

Each state transition is dependent on the completion (signaled by the appropriate inputs) of the previous step before it can initiate the subsequent action, ensuring the process flows in the correct order.

### Step 5:#### Check the LD you generate according to the IEC 61131 standard.

1. **Coherence**: The Ladder Diagram follows the sequential logic required for batch control in polyethylene production, with a distinct step initiated only after the previous step is complete.
2. **Syntax**: The Ladder Diagram's notation adheres to the IEC 61131-3 standard, using normally open (NO) contacts represented with `----[/]----` to initiate actions based on the states of inputs.
3. **Functionality**: Each step is designed to activate only after its specified conditions are met, preventing any steps from being skipped or initiated prematurely.
4. **Error Handling**: While explicit error handling mechanisms are not defined within this simple representation, the process's linear flow inherently prevents proceeding without the successful completion of the preceding steps.

This Ladder Diagram serves as a foundational blueprint for implementing a batch control system in a polyethylene production process, adhering to the fundamental principles outlined by the IEC 61131-3 standard.
