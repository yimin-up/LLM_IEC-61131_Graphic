Given your requirements, I'll create a simplified version of the start-up and shut-down sequences for the 3D pouch-making machine using the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) syntax in a manner that follows the IEC 61131-3 standard. Note that this is a conceptual diagram represented in ASCII art, which would typically be implemented using a graphical SFC editor in PLC programming software.

For enhanced clarity and simplicity, I'll focus on the main processes: Heating, Cooling, Cutting (horizontal and vertical), and Raw Material Feeding with tension control.

**Startup Sequence:**

```
          +------------------+
          |    StartStep     |
          +---------+--------+
                    |
                    v
          +---------+---------+
          |Initialize Feeders |
  +------->and Tension Control|
  |       +---------+---------+
  |                 |
  |                 v
  |       +---------+---------+
  |       |   Heat Station    |--------+
  |       |    Activation     |        |
  |       +---------+---------+        |
  |                 |                  |
  |                 v                  |

  |                 |                  |
  |                 v                  |
  +<-----+      Check Sensors       >--+
          +---------+---------+
                    |
                    v
          +---------+--------+
          |  Cutters Enable  |
          +---------+--------+
                    |
                    v
          +---------+---------+
          |    Operation      |
          |       Mode        |
          +-------------------+
```

**Shutdown Sequence:**

```
          +------------------+
          |   ShutdownReq    |
          +---------+--------+
                    |                 
                    v
          +---------+---------+
          | Cutters Disable   |
          +---------+---------+
                    |
                    v
          +---------+---------+
          | Cool & Heat Off   |
  +------+|  Station Disable  |
  |       +---------+---------+
  |                 |

          +---------+---------+

                    v
          +---------+---------+
          |     Feeders       |
          |     Shutdown      |
          +---------+---------+
                    |
                    v
          +---------+---------+
          |   ShutdownComp   |
          +-------------------+
```

These SFC diagrams are simplified and conceptual. Each step in the sequence should be designed with conditions for transitioning to the next step based on process variables and sensor inputs. The sensor checks, both in the start-up and shutdown sequences, should evaluate conditions such as temperatures at the heating and cooling stations, tension in the feed material, and emergency stop statuses.

Remember that integrating interlocks, emergency stops, and detailed error handling is essential for a real-world application. Further, it's important to collaborate closely with the machine operators and mechanical designers to understand all operational requirements fully.

For actual implementation, each step above would be developed with in-depth logic in structured text (ST), ladder logic (LD), or another IEC 61131-3 programming language suitable for the task at hand.
