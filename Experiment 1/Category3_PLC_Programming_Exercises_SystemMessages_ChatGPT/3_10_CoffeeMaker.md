Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program for a coffee machine.

This machine contains three tanks, each for coffee, milk, and mixer, and three valves, one for the coffee, one for the milk, and the last valve for the output. This coffee machine contains a mixer, which is required to mix the coffee and milk properly to create the best output, The mixer is designed to work for four seconds after which it will automatically stop and the output valve will open to get the output.

The mixer is designed with a timer and will automatically start when the mixer tank reaches the maximum level, the tank is attached to the mixer as both the valves of coffee and milk are open and it started to fill the mixer and then the tank level comes into play with the preset maximum level, the mixer tank can be filled up to 130ml as it reaches the maximum level, the valves of coffee and milk will close and then it will start the mixing.

The coffee machine contains four Push buttons. Button one is for emergency stop, Button two is to start the machine, Button three is for Coffee and Milk and the last button is for Coffee only. The emergency stop is use as a safety button if anything goes wrong in the machine like if any of the valves not open, if the tank level does not work properly, if the mixer fails to work properly or any of the unexpected events occur, then there is a need of emergency stop to stop the machine instantly.

To create a Structured Text program for the described coffee machine, adhering to the IEC 61131-3 standard, we need to consider various elements like tanks, valves, mixer, push buttons, and their interrelations. Here's a sample program that should meet your requirements:

```pascal
PROGRAM CoffeeMachine
    VAR
        // Tank levels in ml
        CoffeeTank : INT := 0;
        MilkTank : INT := 0;
        MixerTank : INT := 0;
        MixerTimer : TON;
        EmergencyStop, MachineStart, CoffeeMilk, CoffeeOnly : BOOL;

        // Valves state: TRUE when open
        ValveCoffee, ValveMilk, ValveOutput : BOOL;
    END_VAR

    // Initialization
    MixerTimer(IN:=FALSE, PT:=T#4s); // 4-second timer for the mixer

    // Control logic
    IF EmergencyStop THEN
        ValveCoffee := FALSE;
        ValveMilk := FALSE;
        ValveOutput := FALSE;
        MixerTimer(IN:=FALSE);
        // Reset tanks
        CoffeeTank := 0;
        MilkTank := 0;
        MixerTank := 0;
    ELSIF MachineStart THEN
        IF CoffeeMilk THEN
            ValveCoffee := TRUE;
            ValveMilk := TRUE;
        ELSIF CoffeeOnly THEN
            ValveCoffee := TRUE;
            ValveMilk := FALSE;
        END_IF;

        // Filling Mixer Tank
        IF ValveCoffee THEN
            MixerTank := MixerTank + 1; // Incrementing mixer tank level
        END_IF;
        IF ValveMilk THEN
            MixerTank := MixerTank + 1; // Incrementing mixer tank level
        END_IF;

        // Checking Mixer Tank Level
        IF MixerTank >= 130 THEN
            ValveCoffee := FALSE;
            ValveMilk := FALSE;
            MixerTimer(IN:=TRUE); // Start mixing
        END_IF;

        // Mixing process
        IF MixerTimer.Q THEN
            ValveOutput := TRUE; // Open output valve after mixing
            MixerTank := 0; // Reset Mixer Tank
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
END_PROGRAM
```

Explanation:

Initialization: We define the initial states of the tanks, valves, and the mixer timer.
Emergency Stop: If the emergency stop button is pressed, all valves are closed, the mixer is stopped, and the tanks are reset.
Machine Start: When the machine is started, it checks which mode is selected (Coffee & Milk or Coffee Only) and opens the respective valves.
Filling Mixer Tank: The mixer tank level is increased based on the valves opened.
Mixer Tank Level Check: Once the mixer tank reaches 130ml, the coffee and milk valves close, and the mixing process starts.
Mixing Process: After the mixer runs for 4 seconds, the output valve is opened to serve the drink.
This program assumes that there are mechanisms in place to physically measure and control the tank levels and valve states. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific hardware and sensors available in the actual coffee machine.
