**Notes:**

*   Each state represents a specific operation of the elevator.
*   Transitions between states are triggered by specific conditions, such as button presses, timer expirations, or sensor inputs.
*   The program includes actions within each state, such as starting/stopping the motor, opening/closing the door, and activating timers. 
*   The "DETERMINE\_DIRECTION" state would use logic to evaluate the current direction, pending up/down button requests, and floor levels to decide the next movement direction.
*   This SFC program provides a basic framework. Additional details and actions might be necessary depending on the specific elevator system and its functionalities.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Safety Interlocks:** Implement safety interlocks for door operation and motor control to prevent accidents.
*   **Error Handling:** Include error handling routines for unexpected situations or sensor failures.
*   **Floor Level Tracking:** Keep track of the current floor level using sensors or counters.
*   **Timers and Counters:** Use timers and counters for precise timing and sequencing of actions.
*   **Variable Declarations:** Declare all necessary variables, including timers, counters, and input/output signals.

**Remember, this is a simplified representation. Adapting it to a real-world application requires careful consideration of safety regulations, specific hardware, and desired functionalities.**
