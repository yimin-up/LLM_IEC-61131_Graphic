Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 sequential function chart program for a traffic light controller that reacts to pedestrian buttons and gives priority to emergency vehicles:

```
PROGRAM TrafficLight
VAR
  EmergencyVehicle : BOOL := FALSE;  // Input - Presence of emergency vehicle 
  PedestrianButton : BOOL := FALSE;  // Input - Pedestrian push button
  CarTrafficRed    : BOOL := FALSE;  // Output - Red light for car traffic
  CarTrafficYellow : BOOL := FALSE;  // Output - Yellow light for car traffic 
  CarTrafficGreen  : BOOL := FALSE;  // Output - Green light for car traffic
  PedestrianRed    : BOOL := FALSE;  // Output - Red light for pedestrians
  PedestrianGreen  : BOOL := FALSE;  // Output - Green light for pedestrians
  tGreen : TIME := T#45s;  // Green light duration 
  tYellow : TIME := T#5s;  // Yellow light duration
  tRed : TIME := T#2s;     // All red duration
  tWalk : TIME := T#20s;   // Pedestrian walk duration
END_VAR

INITIAL_STEP NormalOperation:
  CarTrafficGreen := TRUE;
  PedestrianRed := TRUE;

TRANSITION FROM NormalOperation TO PedestrianRequest
  := PedestrianButton;

STEP PedestrianRequest:
  CarTrafficGreen := FALSE;
  CarTrafficYellow := TRUE;

TRANSITION FROM PedestrianRequest TO AllRed 
  := tYellow;

STEP AllRed:
  CarTrafficYellow := FALSE;  
  CarTrafficRed := TRUE;

TRANSITION FROM AllRed TO PedestrianWalk
  := tRed;

STEP PedestrianWalk:
  PedestrianRed := FALSE;
  PedestrianGreen := TRUE; 

TRANSITION FROM PedestrianWalk TO NormalOperation
  := tWalk;

TRANSITION FROM NormalOperation TO EmergencyMode
  := EmergencyVehicle;

STEP EmergencyMode:
  CarTrafficRed := TRUE;
  CarTrafficYellow := FALSE;
  CarTrafficGreen := FALSE;
  PedestrianRed := TRUE;
  PedestrianGreen := FALSE;

TRANSITION FROM EmergencyMode TO NormalOperation 
  := NOT EmergencyVehicle;

END_PROGRAM
```

This SFC program defines the traffic light sequence and transitions between states based on timers and the status of the pedestrian button and emergency vehicle sensor. 

In normal operation, car traffic has a green light while pedestrians have a red light. When the pedestrian button is pushed, it transitions to yellow then red for cars, and green for pedestrians for a walk interval. After the walk, it returns to normal operation.

If an emergency vehicle is detected at any point, it immediately transitions to an emergency mode, where all lights are red except the emergency vehicle light (not shown). It stays in this mode until the emergency vehicle is no longer detected.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
