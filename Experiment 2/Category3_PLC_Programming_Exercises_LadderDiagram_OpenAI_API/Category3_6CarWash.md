> Write a PLC program in Ladder Diagram according to IEC 61131-3 to create an automatic car wash station with only one station. Station detects if a car is there by a sensor and if no human is present (In the car wash area) then it start to wash to car. If there is any human detected in the car wash area then the car wash station should stop and send an alarm.

To design this PLC program for an automatic car wash station according to IEC 61131-3 using a Ladder Diagram in ASCII art, we need to consider the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs:  
- Car Presence Sensor (CPS): Detects if a car is present.
- Human Presence Sensor (HPS): Detects if a human is present in the car wash area.

Outputs:  
- Car Wash (CW): Controls the car wash process.
- Alarm (ALM): Activates an alarm if a human is detected in the car wash area.

Let's draw the PLC Ladder Diagram in ASCII art:

```
      +----[/]----[/]----( )----+
      |    CPS    HPS     CW    |
      |                         |
      |                         |
      |    +----[/]-------------+
      |    |    HPS             |
      +----+----[ ]-------------+
           |    ALM             |
           +---------------------+
```

Explanation:

- Line 1: This is the main line of operation for the car wash. The Car Presence Sensor (CPS) and the Human Presence Sensor (HPS) are used in series to make a decision. If a car is present (CPS is ON) and no human is detected (HPS is OFF), then the Car Wash (CW) output is activated, starting the car wash process.
    - `[/]` represents a normally open (NO) contact.
    - `( )` represents a coil, which activates an output.
- Line 2 to 4: This section handles the alarm in case a human is detected in the car wash area.
- Line 5: If the Human Presence Sensor (HPS) detects a human (HPS is ON), the Alarm (ALM) output is activated. 
    - `[/]` here represents a normally open (NO) contact for the HPS, which closes if a human is detected, activating the alarm.
    - `[ ]` represents a normally closed (NC) contact, but it is not used in this specific scenario; included just for illustration of a typical diagram element.

The logic starts by checking if the car is present and no human is detected; if these conditions are met, the car wash process is activated. Concurrently, if at any point a human is detected in the area, the alarm will be triggered.

Remember, the actual implementation may require additional considerations such as timing functions (for the different stages of the car wash process), safety interlocks, manual overrides, and more, depending on the specific application needs and safety standards.
