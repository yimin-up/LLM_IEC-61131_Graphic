Creating a comprehensive and detailed Ladder Diagram for an elevator control system covering all the specified requirements can be quite complex. However, I'll sketch a basic structure to illustrate how one might start building such a system using ASCII art to represent the ladder logic.

```

|  [Direction + Floor Control]                         |
|                             [Move Elevator Logic]    |

|                                                      |

```
This simplified example includes placeholders for:

- **Up Calls and Down Calls**: Buttons outside the elevator to call it to a specific floor.
- **Cabin Calls**: Buttons inside the elevator cabin for selecting floors.
- **Limit Switches**: These are switches on each floor to detect the elevator's position, with "B" for Bottom and "T" for Top switch of each floor.
- **Timers for Door Operations**: "TON" blocks represent timers for door operations¡ª7 seconds for door open duration, and 10 seconds idle time before attempting to reopen.
- **Direction + Floor Control**: Logic to decide the elevator movement direction based on the calls and current position.
- **Safety Checks**: Including door open detection and obstruction detection, to ensure safe operation.
  
This is an extremely basic representation. A real-world application would require detailed safety feature implementation, more complex floor and direction decision logic, handling simultaneous button presses, maintaining queue of floor requests, and emergency stop functionalities, among others. Each of these functions could significantly expand the ladder diagram.
