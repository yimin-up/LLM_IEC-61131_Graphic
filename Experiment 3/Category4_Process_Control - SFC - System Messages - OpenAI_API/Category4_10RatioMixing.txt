To implement a ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2 to 1 ratio using Sequential Function Chart (SFC) programming according to IEC 61131-3 standard, consider a basic process where two reactant valves (Valve_A and Valve_B) control the flow of reactants A and B into a mixing chamber. We aim to maintain the ratio of reactant A to reactant B as 2:1 by volume or flow rate. We are assuming basic control where Valve_A and Valve_B can be ON (open) or OFF (closed), and for simplicity, that opening valves instantly achieves target flow rates.

This ASCII representation is a simplified concept. In practice, the implementation would require integrating with the specific PLC programming environment and interfacing with the relevant input/output (I/O) modules for sensors (e.g., flow meters) and actuators (i.e., the valves).

- **Start_Mixing**: Initial step where the decision is made to start the mixing process.
- **Check_Ratios**: Assess if the desired ratio can be maintained with the flow rates achievable.
- **Open_Valve_A_x2**: Opens Valve A to start the flow of reactant A into the mixing chamber. The "x2" indicates the action to maintain the ratio, suggesting this step takes twice as long as opening Valve B or implies double the flow rate, but the specific completion criteria depend on real flow rates and are simplified here.
- **Open_Valve_B**: Opens Valve B to allow reactant B to flow into the mixing chamber.
- **Mixing_Complete**: After both steps have operated for the correct duration to ensure the 2:1 ratio, this step marks the end of the mixing process.

**Transitions**:
- Between "Check_Ratios" and "Open_Valve_A_x2": Confirm that flow rates or volumes can be controlled to achieve the 2:1 ratio.
- From "Open_Valve_B" to "Mixing_Complete": A timer or specific volume measurement can act as a transition, indicating that enough reactant has been mixed according to the 2:1 ratio.

This sequence simplifies many complexities like flow rate control, reaction time, and actual volume or concentration measurements. In practice, you would require integrating feedback loops using analog input values from flow meters and potentially adjusting the valve positions to maintain the desired ratio precisely, not just opening or closing them fully.
