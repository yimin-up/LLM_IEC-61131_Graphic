Creating a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for a polyethylene production process involves defining the steps and transitions between these steps. Each step is a phase in the process, such as raw material preparation, polymerization, and so forth. Transitions are conditions that allow the process to move from one step to the next. In an actual implementation, each step might involve more detailed logic or calls to function blocks that perform specific tasks, but here we'll focus on defining the steps and transitions in ASCII art to illustrate the concept according to the IEC 61131-3 standard.

Remember, implementing this SFC in a real PLC programming environment will require additional PLC programming constructs, such as timers for delays, sensors for real-world condition checks, and actuators to perform actions.

Here is an ASCII representation of the SFC for the polyethylene production process:

Each box represents a step in the process, and arrows indicate the flow or transition from one step to the next. The transitions here are implied to be the completion of each step or meeting certain conditions, which should be specified in the actual PLC program (using control logic, sensor inputs, etc.).

In an IEC 61131-3 compliant environment, specific conditions or logic would be programmed within each transition. For simplicity, these conditions aren't explicitly shown in the ASCII diagram. This diagram visualizes the higher-level process flow, which then needs to be translated into structured text (ST), ladder diagram (LD), or another PLC programming language with the applicable conditions and actions for each step, following the detailed requirements of the polyethylene production process.

Note: In a real-world application, safety steps, error handling, interlocks, and feedback loops would also be crucial components of the control strategy, not covered in this high-level overview.
