Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program for packaging bottles. After filling, the bottles are moved with a conveyor to packaging. A proximity sensor detects any bottle, another one only empty bottles. A cylinder removes empty bottles.

To create a Structured Text program for this packaging process in accordance with IEC 61131-3, we need to consider the various components and their interactions. The components include a conveyor belt, a proximity sensor to detect any bottle, a specific sensor to detect empty bottles, and a cylinder to remove the empty bottles. The program will control these components based on sensor inputs.

Here's a basic outline of the program:

Variables Definition: Define variables for the sensors (proximity and empty bottle detector) and actuators (conveyor and cylinder).

Logic Implementation:

The conveyor belt should be running as long as the system is active.
When the proximity sensor detects a bottle (any bottle), it might need to activate certain processes (like counting or logging), but it doesn't directly interact with the cylinder.
When the sensor for empty bottles detects an empty bottle, it should activate the cylinder to remove the bottle.
Safety and Error Handling: Include conditions to handle error states, like jamming or sensor failure.

Here is a simplified Structured Text program based on these principles:

```pascal
PROGRAM BottlePackaging
VAR
    ConveyorRunning : BOOL; // Conveyor belt status
    ProximitySensor : BOOL; // Detects any bottle
    EmptyBottleSensor : BOOL; // Detects empty bottles
    CylinderActuator : BOOL; // Activates to remove empty bottles
END_VAR

// Main control loop
ConveyorRunning := TRUE; // Keep the conveyor running

// Check for any bottle
IF ProximitySensor THEN
    // Process for any bottle (e.g., count, log, etc.)
END_IF

// Check for empty bottle and activate cylinder to remove it
IF EmptyBottleSensor THEN
    CylinderActuator := TRUE;
ELSE
    CylinderActuator := FALSE;
END_IF

// Safety or Error Handling Logic (if required)
// ...

END_PROGRAM
```

This program is a basic representation and does not include detailed error handling or specific conditions for conveyor speed control, bottle handling specifics, or detailed safety measures, which would be necessary in a real-world application. Additionally, the actual sensor and actuator interfaces might require more complex interactions depending on the hardware used.
