Explanation:
1. The system starts in the "Initial" step.
2. When a car is detected by the sensor (CarDetected), it transitions to the "WashCar" step.
3. In the "WashCar" step, the "StartWash" action is executed to begin the car washing process.
4. If a human is detected in the car wash area (HumanDetected) during the washing process, it immediately transitions to the "EmergencyStop" step.
5. In the "EmergencyStop" step, the "StopWash" action is executed to halt the washing process, and an "Alarm" action is triggered to alert about the presence of a human.
6. If the human is no longer detected (NOT HumanDetected), it transitions to the "WashDone" step, indicating that the washing process is complete.
7. When the car is no longer detected (NOT CarDetected), it transitions back to the "Initial" step, ready for the next car.

This SFC ensures that the car wash station operates automatically when a car is detected and stops immediately if a human is detected in the car wash area, providing a safety mechanism.
