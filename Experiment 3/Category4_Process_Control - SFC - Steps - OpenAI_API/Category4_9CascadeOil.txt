Step 1:####
To implement a cascade control system for the pressure in an oil refinery vessel using IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart (SFC), we first need to define the inputs and outputs involved in the process:

Inputs:
1. PV_Primary (Pressure Value of Primary loop): The actual pressure measurement in the vessel.
2. SP_Primary (Set Point of Primary loop): The desired pressure in the vessel.
3. PV_Secondary (Flow Value of Secondary loop): The actual flow measurement of oil into the vessel.
4. SP_Secondary (Set Point of Secondary loop): The desired flow of oil into the vessel, which is dynamically adjusted based on the output of the primary loop.

Outputs:
1. OP_Primary (Output of Primary loop): Control signal to adjust the pressure in the vessel, affecting the SP_Secondary.
2. OP_Secondary (Output of Secondary loop): Control signal to adjust the flow of oil into the vessel.

####

Step 2:####
The state machine for this cascade control system can be described as follows:

1. Initialize: Set initial conditions for the control system.
2. Read Inputs: Read the current pressure (PV_Primary) and flow rate (PV_Secondary).
3. Primary Control: Adjust OP_Primary based on the difference between SP_Primary and PV_Primary.
4. Update Secondary Setpoint: Update SP_Secondary based on OP_Primary.
5. Secondary Control: Adjust OP_Secondary based on the difference between SP_Secondary and PV_Secondary.
6. Loop: Repeat the Read Inputs, Primary Control, Update Secondary Setpoint, and Secondary Control steps to continuously adjust the process.

Step 3:####
Here is the Sequential Function Chart program in ASCII art to implement the described cascade control logic:

```

           |
           V

           |
           V

           |
           V

           |
           V

+-------------------+
           |
           +-----------------------------+
           |                             |
           |                             |
           +<----------------------------+
```

Step 4:####
- **Initialize**: Set initial conditions, such as initial set points and ensuring outputs are in a safe state before starting the process control.
- **Read Inputs**: This step involves reading the current state of the process variables, i.e., the primary pressure (PV_Primary) and the secondary flow rate (PV_Secondary).
- **Primary Control**: In this step, the primary loop calculates the adjustment needed (OP_Primary) to maintain the desired pressure (SP_Primary) within the vessel. The control action can range from simple PID control to more advanced control strategies.
- **Update Secondary Setpoint**: Based on the output of the primary control step (OP_Primary), this step adjusts the setpoint (SP_Secondary) for the secondary loop, effectively cascading the control effort from the primary to the secondary loop.
- **Secondary Control**: With the updated setpoint from the primary loop, this step adjusts the secondary flow control (OP_Secondary) to maintain the desired flow rate into the vessel. This directly impacts the pressure control by ensuring the correct amount of oil is being fed into the vessel.
- The chart loops back to "Read Inputs" to continuously monitor and adjust the process, thus implementing a dynamic and responsive control system.

####

Step 5:####
The SFC follows the IEC 61131-3 standard by:
- Structuring the control process into clear, sequential steps that enable a systematic approach to complex control, aligning with the sequential nature of the SFC.
- Each action (step) is defined to perform specific tasks, adhering to the modular design principle of IEC 61131-3.
- Transitions between steps ensure the process moves logically from one state to another based on the control logic, inputs received, and conditions checked, complying with the SFC's requirement for condition-based progression.
- The cyclic loop back to "Read Inputs" after executing the "Secondary Control" ensures continuous control, fitting the standard's provisions for repetitive and cyclical operations in process control systems.

By adhering to these principles, the SFC ensures a robust and standard-compliant cascade control implementation for the oil refinery's pressure system.
