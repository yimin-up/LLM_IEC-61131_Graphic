Given the specifics, let's design a basic control sequence for the "B.2 Reaction" step within an adhesive production process. We'll align with ISA-88 batch control structure as is relevant, focusing on implementing a sequential control block for this step using IEC 61131-3 Ladder Diagram (LD) notation. For simplicity, the explanation will precede the ASCII LD representation. Please note, creating an elaborate ISA-88 recipe and detailed step implementations would exceed the scope of a single response, but we can focus on a foundational example within these constraints.

### B.2 Reaction Step Overview

In the "B.2 Reaction" step, let's say the process requires:
- Mixing for a set time period (e.g., 5 minutes).
- Heating the mixture to a specific temperature (e.g., 90°C) and maintaining this temperature for a set duration (e.g., 20 minutes).
- Cooling down to a specific temperature (e.g., 25°C) before proceeding.

### Assumptions:
- There is an existing system of sensors and actuators wired to the PLC, including mixers (`MIXER`), heaters (`HEATER`), and coolers (`COOLER`).
- Temperature sensors (`TEMP_SENSOR`) provide real-time feedback.
- Timers (`TMIX`, `THEAT`, and `TCOOL`) manage durations for mixing, heating, and cooling.

### Control Logic in Ladder Diagram (ASCII Art)

Given the constraints, we'll divide the control logic into segments for clarity. Here's how you could start:

1. **Mixing Control** - activate the mixer for 5 minutes.

```plaintext
|--[ ]----------------( )--| MIXER
   |                         |
   |--[TMIX]---[/]-----------| Timer for 5 minutes

Note: [ ] = Normally open contact, [/] = Timer done
```

2. **Heating Control** - heat to 90°C, then maintain for 20 minutes.

```plaintext
|--[>90]-------------[ ]----------------( )--| HEATER and THEAT Timer Start
   TEMP_SENSOR           THEAT done           |
   |--[/]----------------------------( )--|    HEATER Off
        THEAT
Note: [>90] = Greater than comparison, [/] = Timer done 
```

3. **Cooling Control** - start cooling when the temperature is above 25°C after heating phase; stop when reaching 25°C.

```plaintext
|--[>25]------------------------------------( )--| COOLER
   TEMP_SENSOR
Note: [>25] = Greater than comparison
```

4. **Full Sequence Control** - The actual calling of these methods (blocks of control logic) to seamlessly integrate within a batch process requires an overarching control structure, which could look something like this in simplified form:

```plaintext
|--[START]---[ ]---[ ]--------[ ]---( )--| STEP 1: MIXING_START
             |      |          |          |
             |      |          |-----[ ]--| STEP 2: HEATING_START
             |      |                 |
             |      |------------[ ]--| STEP 3: COOLING START
             |                         |
             |---[ ]--------------------| STEP 4: END
                 [TMIX, THEAT, TC+OOL DONE]
```

In the diagram above, each step would be activated sequentially assuming each previous step's conditions are met (e.g., timers done).

### Practical Consideration
This abstracted example demonstrates core ideas without diving into the full granularity of signal conditioning, error handling, interlocks, or ISA-88 recipe management, which are all pivotal in real-world applications. In an actual PLC program, each ‘step’ would be more complex, monitoring conditions more precisely, incorporating safety checks, and adapting to real-time feedback beyond simple timers. The integration with ISA-88 principles would typically involve a higher-level process management system that interprets the batch recipe, issuing commands to the PLC to execute corresponding control actions, while monitoring for process completion or fault conditions to proceed to the next steps or take corrective action, respectively.
