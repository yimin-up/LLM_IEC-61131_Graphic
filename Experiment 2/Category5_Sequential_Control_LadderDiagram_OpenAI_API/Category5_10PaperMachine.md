Creating a comprehensive startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine requires careful consideration of the typical operations, safety measures, and specific parameters involved in this critical section of the paper manufacturing process. The press section's main goal is to remove water from the paper web through pressing to improve the paper's strength and reduce energy use in the drying section.

For this exercise, a simplified version of such a sequence will be outlined, focusing on the essential steps required to bring the press section up to operational status and ensure it operates within safe and optimal parameters.

**Startup Sequence Outline for the Press Section:**

1. **Safety Checks**: Ensure all emergency stops are reset, and no faults are present in the system.
2. **Hydraulic System Preparation**: This involves charging the hydraulic system that operates the press rolls.
   - Target Pressure: 150 bar
   - Warm-up Time: 5 minutes
3. **Pre-loading of Press Rolls**: Gradually apply pressure to the press rolls to reach the initial pre-loading state.
   - Initial Pressure: 50 bar
4. **Section Speed Synchronization**: Adjust the press section speed to match the speed of the forming section to prevent web breaks.
   - Initial Speed: 500 meters per minute (this could vary significantly depending on specific machine configurations)
5. **Moisture Content Adjustment**: Start the moisture control system to ensure the web enters the drying section with consistent moisture content.
   - Target Moisture: 65%
6. **Full Pressing Force Application**: Gradually increase to full operational pressing force once the machine speed and moisture content are stable.
   - Operational Pressure: 100 bar

**Ladder Diagram ASCII Art Implementation:**

Given the complexity of implementing a complete and detailed control program within the scope of this response, we'll focus on a simplified ASCII art representation of the ladder logic for step 2: Hydraulic System Preparation. This example illustrates controlling the hydraulic pump and monitoring system pressure to reach the target operational conditions.

+----[ ]----+----( )----+            Legend:
|  Start    |  Pump ON  |            [ ] - Normally open contact
+----[ ]----+           |            ( ) - Coil
|  Pump FB  |           |            |-| - Connection

| Pressure  |  Pump OFF |
| < 150 bar |           |
+-----------+-----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **Start**: This is the start input that initiates the hydraulic system preparation sequence.
- **Pump ON**: This coil activates the hydraulic pump.
- **Pump FB (Feedback)**: A feedback contact that indicates the pump is currently on; this is used for interlocking to prevent pump restarting if it's already on.
- **Pressure < 150 bar**: This contact is true when the pressure is below 150 bar, ensuring the pump remains on until the target pressure is reached.
- **Pump OFF**: This coil would deactivate the pump, but in this part of the sequence, it's not activated; it's included for demonstration purposes and would be used elsewhere in the full program logic. 

Please note, in practice, more detailed conditions, interlocks, and sequences would be implemented to ensure operational safety, efficiency, and equipment protection. Also, various sensors and actuators (not fully detailed here) would inform the PLC about the current state of the machine and allow for precise control over the paper-making process. Remember, PLC programming requires in-depth understanding of both the programming language and the controlled process. This simplified example is mainly educational and a starting point for designing more complex systems.
