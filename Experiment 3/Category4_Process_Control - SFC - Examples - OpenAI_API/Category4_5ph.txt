Creating a self-contained Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program to implement PID feedback pH control involves defining the necessary steps, transitions, and actions to maintain the pH level within a desired range using PID control methodology. In a practical PLC programming environment, more in-depth configuration of PID parameters (proportional, integral, and derivative gains) would be required, which typically cannot be fully covered in an ASCII art representation. However, I can outline a basic structure that gives an idea of how this process would be organized within an SFC framework according to IEC 61131-3 standards.

This simplified SFC aims to control the pH by adjusting a dosing pump's speed or by opening a valve to add a correcting agent (acid or base) into the system to maintain the pH at the desired level.

Key Elements of the SFC:

1. **pH_Read()** 每 Transition condition; a function that reads the current pH level from the sensor. Since transitions in SFC are conditions for moving from one state/action to another, this function is used to assess if the control should adjust the pH or remain in its current state.

2. **Initial State** 每 The starting point of the program, where initial conditions can be set or checked. This could involve ensuring communication with sensors and actuators is established.

3. **Adjust_pH** 每 Action block where the logic for adjusting the pH is executed. This would involve calculating the difference between the current pH and setpoint, then using the PID algorithm to determine the appropriate amount of corrective agent to dose.

4. **Calculate_PID** 每 A critical action block where the PID control calculations are performed. Inputs would be the error (difference between setpoint and actual pH), and outputs would be the adjustments needed, passed on to control valves or dosing pumps.

5. **pH_in_Range** 每 Transition condition; checks if the pH has reached or is maintained within the desired range. This would likely be a narrow band around the setpoint to avoid constant adjustments.

6. **Maintenance** 每 An action block intended for any ongoing checks or operations required to maintain the system's status quo when not actively adjusting the pH. This could also serve as a placeholder for error handling or other system checks.

This ASCII art SFC is a high-level representation. Implementing a PID control in a real PLC program would involve detailed configuration of the PID function block parameters, handling sensor inputs/outputs, and ensuring the actuators (valves, pumps) are operated within safe and effective ranges.
