Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Sequential Function Chart program to control a heating system to maintain temperature between 20-22буC based on 3 temperature sensors:

|         |       |
|        (2)      |
|         |       |
|    +---------+  |
|    | HEATING |  |
|    |   ON    |  |

          |
       +----+
       | S2 |---->
       +----+

S1: avg(temp1, temp2, temp3) > 22
S2: avg(temp1, temp2, temp3) < 20

(1): avg(temp1, temp2, temp3) <= 22
(2): avg(temp1, temp2, temp3) >= 20

INIT:
    heater := OFF;

HEATING OFF:
    heater := OFF;

HEATING ON: 
    heater := ON;

This SFC has 3 steps:
1. INIT - initializes heater to off state
2. HEATING OFF - turns heater off when avg temp > 22буC 
3. HEATING ON - turns heater on when avg temp < 20буC

Transitions:
- S1 moves from HEATING ON to HEATING OFF when avg temp exceeds 22буC
- S2 moves from HEATING OFF to HEATING ON when avg temp drops below 20буC  
- (1) and (2) loop in their respective steps while temp is 20-22буC range

The avg() function calculates the average of the 3 temperature sensor readings. The heater coil is turned on/off accordingly to maintain the temperature between 20-22буC.
