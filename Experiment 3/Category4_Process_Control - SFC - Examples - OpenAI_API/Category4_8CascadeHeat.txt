Creating a sequential control for temperature regulation in a heat exchanger involves multiple stages, including measuring the temperature, activating the heating or cooling system, and ensuring the system operates within defined safety parameters. Below is an outline of a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) represented in ASCII for cascade control of temperature in a heat exchanger according to IEC 61131-3.

Keep in mind, an actual SFC program would include specific instructions for each action and condition tests within a PLC programming environment. Here, we provide a conceptual outline.

Explanation of the Stages:
1. **Initial**: The starting point of the control system where preconditions or initial checks are made.
2. **Measure Temp**: The temperature of the heat exchanger is measured and compared to the setpoint.
3. **Adjust Heating/Cooling (Primary Control Loop)**: Based on the deviation from the setpoint, adjust the heating or cooling to bring the temperature towards the desired setpoint. This is the primary loop in cascade control.
4. **Monitor Secondary Parameters**: In addition to temperature control, it's essential to monitor secondary parameters for safety and efficiency, including pressure, flow rate, and other safety checks.
5. **Adjust Setpoints (Cascade Control)**: Adjustments to the setpoints of the primary control loop based on secondary parameters. This could involve adjusting the temperature setpoint to compensate for changes in flow rate or other factors.
6. **System Stable & Maintain**: Once the system reaches a stable state with temperature and secondary parameters within desired ranges, maintain current settings. Any significant changes loop back to reevaluation and adjustment as necessary.

Note: This is a high-level outline for a heat exchanger temperature control using a Sequential Function Chart. Detailed implementation would require programming within a specific PLC environment, respecting the syntax and functionalities offered by the chosen platform, and based on IEC 61131-3 standards.
