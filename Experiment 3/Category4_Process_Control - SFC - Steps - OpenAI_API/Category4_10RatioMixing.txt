Step 1:####
For the requirements of implementing ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio, we first need to define the inputs and outputs of the Sequential Function Chart (SFC).

Inputs:
- Start_Mixing: A boolean input signal to start the mixing process.
- Reactant_A_Level: A numeric input representing the level of Reactant A available for mixing.
- Reactant_B_Level: A numeric input representing the level of Reactant B available for mixing.
- Emergency_Stop: A boolean input signal for stopping the process immediately in case of an emergency.

Outputs:
- Valve_A_Open: A boolean output to control the valve for Reactant A, where TRUE opens the valve.
- Valve_B_Open: A boolean output to control the valve for Reactant B, where TRUE opens the valve.
- Mixing_Motor_On: A boolean output to control the mixing motor, where TRUE turns it on.

####

Step 2:####
The state machine for the ratio control of mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio can be described as follows:

1. Idle: The initial state before mixing starts.
2. Check_Levels: Verify that sufficient levels of Reactant A and Reactant B are available to start the process.
3. Open_Valves: Open the valves to allow Reactants A and B to flow into the mixing chamber in the required ratio.
4. Mixing: Turn on the mixing motor to mix the reactants.
5. Close_Valves: Close the valves once the required amounts of reactants have been added.
6. Emergency_Stop: An immediate transition to a safe state if the emergency stop is triggered at any point.

Step 3:####
Below is the ASCII art representation of the Sequential Function Chart (SFC) program for the given requirements:

         |                                |             |  Mixing   |
         |                                |             +----+------+
         |                                |                  |
         |                                |                  | Mixing_Motor_On := TRUE
         |                                |                  v
         | Start_Mixing                  |             +----+------------+
         | and not                       |             | Close_Valves    |
         | Emergency_Stop                |             +----+------------+
         +-------------------------------+                  |
                       |                                    | Valve_A_Open := FALSE
       Emergency_Stop  |                                    | Valve_B_Open := FALSE
                       |                                    | Mixing_Motor_On := FALSE
                       v                                    v
                 +-----+-------------+                 +----+------+
                 |  Emergency_Stop   |                 |   Idle    |
                 +-------------------+                 +-----------+
```

####

Step 4:####
- **Idle**: The system is ready but not active. It transitions to Check_Levels when the start signal is given and emergency stop is not active.
- **Check_Levels**: This step ensures that there are enough reactants available. If Reactant A's level is at least twice that of Reactant B and Reactant B's level is sufficient, the process moves to Open_Valves.
- **Open_Valves**: The valves for Reactants A and B are opened to allow them into the mixing chamber, ensuring that Reactant A enters at twice the rate of Reactant B. This transitions to the Mixing step.
- **Mixing**: The mixing motor is activated to mix the reactants. This step can transition to Close_Valves after a certain condition is met, usually time-based or quantity-based.
- **Close_Valves**: All valves are closed, and the mixing motor is turned off. This indicates that the required amount of reactants has been mixed, and the system returns to an idle state.
- **Emergency_Stop**: This is an immediate transition that can be triggered at any point. It moves the system to a safe state regardless of the ongoing step.

####

Step 5:####
To check the SFC according to the IEC 61131-3 standard, ensure:
- Each step is connected via transitions, and there's a clear path through the steps according to the process requirements.
- Actions assigned to steps are explicitly defined and relevant to what should occur in that phase of the process (e.g., opening valves, starting the motor).
- Transition conditions are based on the inputs and logical conditions relevant to the process (e.g., level check, emergency stop).
- There's a handling mechanism for emergency stops to ensure the system can safely transition to a secure state regardless of current operation.
- The end state returns the system to an idle condition, ready for the next start command, ensuring the system is reusable without needing a reset.

This SFC respects the standard by clearly defining each phase of the operation, including safety mechanisms and ensuring reusability and safety.
