To implement the described Entry/Exit Control logic for an underground car park using Structured Text (ST) programming according to IEC 61131-3, the following PLC program structure can be used. This program assumes M1, M2, M3, and M4 are already implemented within the PLC to track the cars' movement for one scan cycle after passing the respective photoelectric switches.

```iec
PROGRAM EntryExitControl
    VAR
        X1, X2          : BOOL; // Photoelectric switches
        M1, M2, M3, M4  : BOOL; // Single-scan indicators for vehicle passage
        M20, M30        : BOOL; // Indicates a car entering from ground floor/basement
        Y1, Y2          : BOOL; // Outputs for Red/Green lights
    END_VAR
    
    // Initial State
    Y1 := FALSE; // Turn off Red lights
    Y2 := TRUE;  // Turn on Green lights

    // Process
    M20 := M1 OR M4; // Ground floor car is passing through
    M30 := M2 OR M3; // Basement car is passing through
    
    IF M20 OR M30 THEN
        // A car is in the passage, set Red lights ON and Green lights OFF
        Y1 := TRUE;  // Red lights ON
        Y2 := FALSE; // Green lights OFF
    ELSE
        // The passage is clear, set Green lights ON and Red lights OFF
        Y1 := FALSE; // Red lights OFF
        Y2 := TRUE;  // Green lights ON
    END_IF;
    
END_PROGRAM
```

This program assumes that the intermediate variables M20 and M30 are already computed according to their descriptions, based on the inputs M1, M2, M3, and M4. If those are not computed elsewhere, additional logic would be needed to capture the transitions and assign the intermediate variables appropriately.

This Structured Text snippet shows the basic control logic where if any car from the ground floor or the basement is passing through the single-lane passage, the red light turns on, and the green light turns off, prohibiting entry. Once the passage is clear, the lights switch back to green, allowing cars to enter or exit again.

Make sure to map the physical inputs and outputs (X1, X2, Y1, Y2) correctly in the PLC's configuration to use this ST program. Additional safety interlocks and timing checks may be required to ensure this system operates safely and reliably in a real-world scenario.
