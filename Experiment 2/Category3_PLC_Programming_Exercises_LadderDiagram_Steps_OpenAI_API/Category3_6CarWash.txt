Step 1:####
Inputs and outputs for this Ladder Diagram program include:
- Inputs:
  - CarPresentSensor (CPS): Detects the presence of a car.
    - Symbol: `| |` (Parallel lines represent a normally open contact)
  - HumanPresentSensor (HPS): Detects the presence of a human.
    - Symbol: `|/|` (Parallel lines with a diagonal represent a normally closed contact)
- Outputs:
  - CarWash (CW): Starts the car wash process.
    - Symbol: `( )` (Circle represents a coil)
  - Alarm (ALM): Activates an alarm.
    - Symbol: `( )` (Circle represents a coil)


Step 2:####
Ladder Diagram program:

```
       +----[ | ]----[ |/| ]---------+( )----+
       |    CPS      HPS            CW      |
       |                                    |
       |                                    |
       |    [ | ]-------------------( )-----+
       +---- HPS                     ALM    +
```

In this program, CPS detects if a car is present, and HPS is used to detect if a human is present. Car washing starts only if a car is present and no human is detected. The alarm activates if a human is detected in the car wash area.

Step 3:####
Logical expressions for each rung:

- Rung 1: `CarWash = CarPresentSensor AND NOT HumanPresentSensor`
    - This means that the car wash (CW) starts only if a car is detected (CPS is true) and no human is present (HPS is false).

- Rung 2: `Alarm = HumanPresentSensor`
    - This means the alarm (ALM) is activated if a human is detected (HPS is true).

Step 4:####
Briefly describing the state machine of the Ladder Diagram:

- **Idle State:** 
    - *Inputs:* CarPresentSensor = 0, HumanPresentSensor = 0
    - *Outputs:* CarWash = 0, Alarm = 0
- **Car Present, No Human:** 
    - *Inputs:* CarPresentSensor = 1, HumanPresentSensor = 0
    - *Outputs:* CarWash = 1 (car washing starts), Alarm = 0
- **Car Present, Human Present:** 
    - *Inputs:* CarPresentSensor = 1, HumanPresentSensor = 1
    - *Outputs:* CarWash = 0 (car washing stops), Alarm = 1 (alarm activates)
- **No Car, Human Present:** 
    - *Inputs:* CarPresentSensor = 0, HumanPresentSensor = 1
    - *Outputs:* CarWash = 0, Alarm = 1 (alarm still activates)

Thus, the PLC program ensures safety and operation of the automatic car wash station, reacting promptly to the presence of cars and humans within the car wash area.
