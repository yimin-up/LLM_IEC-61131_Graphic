> Write a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program for a coffee machine.

> This machine contains three tanks, each for coffee, milk, and mixer, and three valves - one for coffee, one for milk, and the last valve for the output. This coffee machine contains a mixer, which is required to blend the coffee and milk properly to create the best output, The mixer is designed to work for four seconds, after which it will automatically stop, and the output valve will open to dispense the output.

> The mixer is designed with a timer and will automatically start when the mixer tank reaches its maximum level, the tank is attached to the mixer with both the coffee and milk valves open, allowing the mixer to fill until it reaches the preset maximum level of 130ml. Once the maximum level is reached, the valves for coffee and milk will close, initiating the mixing process.

> The coffee machine contains four Push buttons. Button one is for emergency stop, Button two is to start the machine, Button three is for Coffee and Milk and the last button is for Coffee only. The emergency stop is used as a safety button if anything goes wrong in the machine, such as if any of the valves not open, if the tank level does not work properly, if the mixer fails to work properly or any of the unexpected events occur, then there is a need of emergency stop to halt the machine instantly.

To design this Ladder Diagram (LD) program for the described coffee machine, we'll consider several factors based on the requirements:

1. **Inputs:**
   - **I1:** Emergency Stop Button
   - **I2:** Start Machine Button
   - **I3:** Coffee and Milk Button
   - **I4:** Coffee Only Button
   - **I5:** Mixer Tank Level Sensor (130ml reached)

2. **Outputs:**
   - **Q1:** Coffee Valve
   - **Q2:** Milk Valve
   - **Q3:** Mixer
   - **Q4:** Output Valve

3. **Timers:**
   - **T1:** Mixer Timer (Preset time of 4 seconds)

Below is the ASCII art representation of the required Ladder Diagram. Due to the complexity of ASCII art and textual limitations, the explanation breaks down the logic into manageable sections.

### LD Program Structure:

#### 1. Start and Emergency Stop Logic
```
      +-----+    +-----+    +-----[ ]----( ) Q1 (Coffee Valve)
      | I1  |----| /   |----| I2
      |     |    |     |    +-----[ ]----( ) Q2 (Milk Valve)
      +-----+    +-----+
(E-Stop)        (Start)

```
This section shows that both the coffee and milk valves (Q1 and Q2) are controlled by the Start button (`I2`), but only if the Emergency Stop (`I1`) has not been activated. The Emergency Stop is normally closed (NC), allowing the circuit to function unless pressed.

#### 2. Coffee and Milk Mix Control
```
      +-----+    +-----+
      | I3  |----|     |----[ ]----( ) Q1 (Coffee Valve)
      |     |    |     |----[ ]----( ) Q2 (Milk Valve)
      +-----+    +-----+
(Coffee & Milk)
```
When the button for Coffee and Milk (`I3`) is pressed, it opens both the coffee and milk valves (Q1 and Q2) to start filling the mixer.

#### 3. Coffee Only Control
```
      +-----+
      | I4  |---------------------------( ) Q1 (Coffee Valve)
      +-----+
 (Coffee Only)
```
This section shows that pressing the Coffee Only button (`I4`) opens only the coffee valve (Q1).

#### 4. Mixer Control and Automatic Output
```
      +-----+    +-----+    +-------+
      | I5  |----|     |----| TON T1 |----+-----[ ]----( ) Q3 (Mixer)
      +-----+    +-----+    | 4s    |    |
                             +-------+    |
                                         +-----( ) Q4 (Output Valve)

```
When the mixer tank level (`I5`) reaches the maximum (130ml), it triggers:
- The mixer (`Q3`) to start via a timer (`T1`) for 4 seconds.
- After 4 seconds, the output valve (`Q4`) opens to dispense the coffee.

### Notes:
- The Emergency Stop (`I1`) wiring ensures that it can immediately stop the operation of all valves and the mixer by breaking the circuit.
- Each push button controls a specific part of the machine allowing for different modes of operation (Coffee only, Coffee and Milk).
- The mixer starts automatically once the tank is full and stops after a 4-second mix cycle, after which the output is dispensed.

This design provides a basic structure but may require fine-tuning for real-world applications, including safety interlocks, actual sensor feedback integration, and more sophisticated error handling or operational modes based on specific requirements.
