Implementing ratio control for mixing two reactants in a 2:1 ratio involves maintaining the proportion of flow between Reactant A and Reactant B. Below is the Ladder Diagram in ASCII art to achieve this functionality, focusing on ensuring Reactant A is twice the amount of Reactant B by monitoring and controlling their flows through flow meters and valves. We'll use counters to simulate the flow for the sake of this example, treating them as indicative of flow measurement.

This Ladder Diagram is simplified and based on an abstraction to illustrate control logic:
- The "Enable Mixing" contact represents the process start condition (like a start button or a condition in the process that initiates mixing).
- The `MUL` block for Reactant A multiplies the targeted flow rate of Reactant B by 2 to maintain the 2:1 ratio, assuming Reactant B's desired flow is set as the base. This output controls Valve A accordingly.
- The `DIV` block for Reactant B divides the flow rate of Reactant A by 2 or simply maintains its own flow rate, ensuring a 2:1 ratio (where Reactant A is set to flow at double the rate). This output controls Valve B.
- STOP Mixing represents the condition to stop or reset the mixing process (like a stop button or process completion condition).
- ValveA_Control and ValveB_Control are outputs controlling the respective valves to adjust the reactants' flow based on the calculated ratio.

Note: This is a conceptual representation. In actual applications, flow measurement devices and continuous control mechanisms (e.g., PID controllers) would be integrated within the PLC program to dynamically adjust valves in real-time to maintain the desired ratio. The use of `MUL` and `DIV` here is abstract and assumes direct control from a single point, which may not be directly applicable in all real PLC environments or might need adaptation to meet specific hardware and process control requirements.
