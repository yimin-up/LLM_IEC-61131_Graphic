> Create an ISA-88 control recipe for batch production of polyvinylchloride by polymerization of vinylchloride monomers. The recipe should contain at least the following stages: polymerize, decover, and dry. Each process stage consists of an ordered set of one or more process operations.
The control recipe should contain at least the following operations:
- Prepare reactor: Evacuate the reactor to remove oxygen.
- Charge: Add demineralized water and surfactants.
- React: Add vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst, heat to 55 - 60°C, and hold at this temperature until the reactor pressure decreases.

> Write a self-contained 61131-3 Ladder Diagram program for the sequential control of the reactor including concrete process parameters and timers.

> Provide the content for the each method.

For your request, I'll create a simplified version of an ISA-88 compliant control recipe for producing polyvinylchloride (PVC) via batch processing in IEC 61131-3 Ladder Logic format, focusing on the primary stages and operations you've outlined. Due to the complexity and safety requirements of chemical processes, please note this example is educational and should not be directly implemented in real applications without thorough analysis and safety measures in place.

### Assumptions:

- Sensors and actuators are connected to the PLC and properly configured.
- Temperature, pressure, and level sensors provide feedback to the PLC.
- Valves and heaters are controlled by output signals from the PLC.
- Process parameters (temperature, pressure, etc.) are within safe limits.
- Timers are used for simplification, although real applications might require more dynamic control strategies based on sensor feedback.

### Ladder Logic Program Overview

#### 1. Prepare Reactor (Evacuate)

- **I:1/0** Evacuation Pump Start/Stop
- **T4:1** Evacuation Time
- **B3:0** Step Completed Flag

```plaintext
----[ ]-------------------( )----
   I:1/0   Evacuation Start
----[/]-------------------( )----
   I:1/0   Stop Evacuation
----[ ]--[DN]----------------( )----
   T4:1    Evacuation Timer   B3:0
```

#### 2. Charge Reactor (Add Demineralized Water and Surfactants)

- **I:1/1** Water Valve Open/Close
- **I:1/2** Surfactant Valve Open/Close
- **T4:2** Water Charge Time
- **T4:3** Surfactant Charge Time
- **B3:1** Step Completed Flag

```plaintext
----[ ]-------------------( )----
   I:1/1   Water Valve Open
----[DN]-------------------( )----
   T4:2    Water Charge Time
----[ ]-------------------( )----
   I:1/2   Surfactant Valve Open
----[DN]-------------------( )----
   T4:3    Surfactant Charge Time
----[ ]--[ ]----------------( )----
   T4:2   T4:3              B3:1
```

#### 3. React (Polymerization)

- **I:1/3** Monomer Valve Open/Close
- **I:1/4** Catalyst Valve Open/Close
- **I:1/5** Heater On/Off
- **T4:4** Reaction Time
- **F8:0** Desired Temperature (55-60°C)
- **F8:1** Actual Temperature
- **B3:2** Step Completed Flag

```plaintext
----[ ]-------------------( )----
   I:1/3   Monomer Valve Open
----[ ]-------------------( )----
   I:1/4   Catalyst Valve Open
----[ ]----[>]-[ ]------------( )----
   F8:1   F8:0 I:1/5         Heater On
----[<]-------------------( )----
   F8:1   60°C             Heater Off
----[ ]--[DN]----------------( )----
   T4:4    Reaction Timer   B3:2

### Sequential Control Logic

This ASCII art provides a basic outline for each phase. In reality, more complex logic would be needed to check for conditions (like ensuring the reactor is correctly evacuated before proceeding) and to handle errors or unexpected states.

The program skips error handling and condition checks for brevity but should include them in actual applications. Additionally, each "Step Completed Flag" (`B3:x`) would be used in the main program to transition between steps and ensure the process follows the correct order.
