Given your requirements, I'll design a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) in an ASCII representation to control a pneumatic system. The IEC 61131-3 standard does not directly specify how to draw SFCs in plain text, but I'll adapt its visual principles to an ASCII format. This example assumes we have input signals for pressure (`PressureSensor`) and flow rate (`FlowSensor`), and control outputs to a valve for flow (`FlowValveControl`) and a pressure regulating device (`PressureRegControl`). The control loop operates on a 100 ms cycle, likely handled by the PLC's hardware or configuration settings outside of this SFC script.

The SFC will be simplified into key steps:
- `Start`: System initialization,
- `CheckPressure`: Ensure pressure is within the given range,
- `AdjustPressure`: Adjust pressure if outside the desired range,
- `CheckFlow`: Ensure flow is at 50 standard liters per minute,
- `AdjustFlow`: Adjust flow if it does not meet the criteria,
- `Operate`: Normal operation under conditions; monitor and cyclically recheck.

ASCII Representation:

```plaintext
[Start]
   |
[V-Init]        (Initial transition, always true after start)
   |
[CheckPressure]-->[T-PressureOK]-->[CheckFlow]
   |                  |No          |    |
   |                  v            |    |
[AdjustPressure]<--[T-AdjustPressure]   |
   |                                  |Yes
   |                                  v
   |<--------------------------------[T-FlowOK]--->[Operate]
   |                                                 |
   |                                             [T-Loop] (100 ms)
   --------------------------------------------------| 
```

Explanation:
- `Start`: Begin the process.
- `V-Init`: Valve and pressure controls are initialized. This step is to ensure that the system is in a known state before entering the control loop.
- `CheckPressure`: Evaluate if the pressure is within the desired range (5.5 to 6 bar).
- `T-PressureOK`: If the pressure is OK, transition to checking the flow. Otherwise, transition to adjusting the pressure.
- `AdjustPressure`: Control logic to bring the pressure within range. Could involve stepping the pressure up or down as needed.
- `CheckFlow`: After pressure is OK, check if the flow rate is at 50 standard liters per minute.
- `T-AdjustPressure` and `T-FlowOK`: Transitions based on sensor feedback to adjust flow or continue to operational state.
- `Operate`: Normal operating conditions; continue to monitor the system.
- `T-Loop`: The 100 ms control loop for monitoring and adjustments as needed. This ensures continuous operation and adjustment based on the sensor inputs.

Code snippet example for transition conditions (not in ASCII representation, but for conceptual understanding):

```iec
T-PressureOK: IF PressureSensor >= 5.5 AND PressureSensor <= 6 THEN true ELSE false;
T-AdjustPressure: IF NOT T-PressureOK THEN true ELSE false;
T-FlowOK: IF FlowSensor = 50 THEN true ELSE false;
T-Loop: Timer >= 100 ms; // This would typically be handled by the PLC's timing configuration to loop back.
```

Remember, this ASCII art representation is an abstract simplification. Actual PLC programming would require integrating these logic blocks into your PLC programming environment, setting up the initial conditions, transitions, actions (like adjusting valve positions), and ensuring the timing and sensor integration are correctly configured.
